This zip file contains four subdirectories - one for each model 
(cfg, lstm, ngram), and one which contains the data used for 
our models, along with a few different files used to clean
that data. 

Instead of zipping our whole git repo, I decided
to submit this stripped-down version of it to save space, as 
it contained multiple copies of the data we used. 

The data subdirectory here contains two copies of our corpus. 
"Data Cleaned"/ contains the data in the form that I used it 
for the CFG model, and "Edited Data"/ contains data in the 
form used by the other two models.

Chen and I also decided that we should not include copies 
of Ghaz's LSTM trained models, as those take up over 200
MB of space. Ghaz has included those files in his 
submission, and we think that should be good enough. We 
definitely don't want our professor downloading so much 
data redundantly!
