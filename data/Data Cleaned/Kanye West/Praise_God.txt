Yeah, I'm shakin' the drop (Drop)
I'm still up on top (Aight)
I been had the bop
The devil my opp, can't pay me to stop (It's lit)
My God at the top (La Flame)

We gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg
Livin', speakin', praise God
Walkin' out the graveyard back to life
I serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night (Hey)
Yeah, this life I'm livin' (I'm livin')
All the advice been tipped in (That thang)
Gave me that grip, no slippin' (That grip)
Out of my mind, went trippin' (My mind)
Tell me take two when I'm on one (I'm on)
That lookout like no one
Kept it real tight like your son (Your son)
Yeah (La Flame)

We gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg
Livin', speakin', praise God
Walkin' out the graveyard back to life
I serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night
