Roll up, roll up; hold up, hold up; po' up, po' up
I feel it
I love to... I wanna... I'm tryna...
I feel it
I'ma rock the boat, work the middle 'til it hurt a little
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel it
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
I feel it
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
I feel it
Bitch better act like you know better
I feel it
Woah
