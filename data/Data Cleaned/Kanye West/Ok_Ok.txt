Okay, now they got me, wanna rap again
Heal the wound and then you stab me in my back again (Uh)
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (Uh)
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend (Bomb)
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my **** in
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Grr)
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (God body)
All you rap **** sound like me, can't tell who is who
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you
Price went up (Yeah), angel investor (Yeah)
Price went up (Uh), angel investor (Yeah)

Okay, okay, I'm not okay
Think they're good, it's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay (Uh)
Think theyâ€™re good, get out the way (Uh)

Okay, okay, I'm not okay (Yuh)
Think they're good, it's not okay
