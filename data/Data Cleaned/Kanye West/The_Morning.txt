Aw, man, made something from nothing

I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would have been G.O.D., except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know

Cars, money, girls and the clothes
All money, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was fronting
God damn, we made something from nothing
