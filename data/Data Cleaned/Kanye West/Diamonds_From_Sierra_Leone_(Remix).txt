Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Uh
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (Uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (Uh)
You know the next question, dawg, "Yo, where Dame at?" (Uh)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (Woo)
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
