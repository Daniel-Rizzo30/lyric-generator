Turn it up!

Step up in this bitch like (Turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like (Turn it up!)
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight (Turn it up!)
And she grabbin' on my, like
She wanna see if it'll fit right (Turn it up!)
That's just the wave

Sun don't shine in the shade, ugh (Turn it up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage, ugh (Turn it up!)
Even when somebody go away (Turn it up!)
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave
(Humming)
