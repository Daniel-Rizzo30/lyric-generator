Please don't ask again, who's up in the van?
They my only fans
I was in my hovercraft, had another laugh
How you roll with them? When you know I'm him

Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control, like a CEO
I thought you should know

On my Instagram, it get outta hand
Why you so mad?


He got it on remote control, like a CEO
Feelin' like the man, feelin' like the man
I was in my hovercraft, floatin' down the path
God just grabbed my hand, had a bigger plan

He got this on remote control
He got it on remote control
'Trol
Woah-woah, woah-woah
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control, like that's to know
Should know
