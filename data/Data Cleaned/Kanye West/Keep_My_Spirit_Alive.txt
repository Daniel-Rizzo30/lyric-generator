Ooh, ooh
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
