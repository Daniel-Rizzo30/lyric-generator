Smoke a opp pack ain't funny like that
It get ugly like that, can't get no money like that
Holy Father, please, let me step in
Can't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that
Whole lotta steppers and they steppin'
And they sunny like that
And they comin' right back
And when you on tour, bet you check-in
'Cause my guys back to work, it's a Monday like that
And when you text, change the beginnin' of every word
You will speak to me with only no cap
Me and your big homie go back
And homie don't rap, you don't know me like that
