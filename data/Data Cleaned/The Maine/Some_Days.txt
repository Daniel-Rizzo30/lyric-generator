Some days feel alone
On your own like a rolling stone
A perfect waste of a perfect day
Some days feel like chores
You get more than you bargain for
A heavy plate for one to undertake

I hate to say I told you so
But I just thought I'd let you know
Some days, they taste like lemonade
Some days can feel like razorblades
I wish I could float away, some days

Some days smell like spring
Birds, they sing, jasmine's blossoming
Everything, oh it's everything
Some times things can seem evergreen
Like the TV screen
Reality, it's reality


Float away, I wish I could float away
I hate to say I told you so
Some days, they taste like lemonade
Some days can feel like razorblades
Oh I wish I could float away
