Spring was everything in '17, now I'm just cold
Summer fell to fall after all November froze
Without you it's a season I ain't needing, I want to go come back home
The reds and all the greens don't mean a thing when you're gone

Winter means nothing
Yes, winter nothing
Winter means nothing to me now
Without you
Without you

I'm having trouble sleeping like a child on Christmas Eve
I'm restless in the night, like the lights upon the tree
Yeah summer fell to fall, after all November's gone
Without you it's a season I ain't needing, I want to come back home

And winter means nothing
Yeah this winter nothing
Yeah, winter means nothing to me now
Without you
Without you
Without you
And winter means nothing
Yeah this winter nothing
Winter means nothing to me now
