I wanna believe, wanna believe all of your energy
Is all that I need, all that I need
Like an amphetamine
But everything inevitably is temporary
And we all come down, down
All come down, down

We ain't gonna stay high forever
Life's a bittersweet (Sweet) surrender
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
We ain't gonna stay high forever
Life's a bittersweet (Sweet) surrender
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
High forever

I wanna believe, wanna beliеve that we're in a fantasy
Whеre you and me live in a dream, dodging reality
But everything inevitably is temporary
And we all come down, down
All come down, down
We ain't gonna stay high forever
Life's a bittersweet (Sweet) surrender
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
We ain't gonna stay high forever
Life's a bittersweet (Sweet) surrender
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
High forever

Wherever you're going
I'm coming with
Everything comes, yeah
Comes to an end
But everything (Everything)
Inevitably
Is temporary and we all come down, down

I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
We ain't gonna stay high forever
Life's a bittersweet (Sweet) surrender
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
High forever
We ain't gonna stay high
High forever
Life's a bittersweet
High forever
I'll follow you, follow you, follow you down
Follow you, follow you down
'Cause we ain't gonna stay high
High forever
