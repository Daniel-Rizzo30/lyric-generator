Last night I saw you in a dream
I'm still not sure just what it means
Two nights before much of the same
I found you dancing on the back of my brain

Hallucinating things are fine in my head
Illuminating the right side of my bed

And we kissed and we fought
I laughed and you screamed
Oh I've learned to loathe these
Goddamn visions
But I just can't wait to fall back to sleep

Oh I woke up and I felt let down
You tied up your sliver hair and left this town
You're three hundred something miles away
I close my eyes and all I see is your face

Hallucinating things are fine in my head
Illuminating the right side of my bed
And we kissed and we fought
I laughed and you screamed
Oh I've learned to loathe these
Goddamn visions
But I just can't wait to fall back to sleep

Hallucinating

And we kissed and we fought
I laughed and you screamed
Oh I've learned to loathe these
Goddamn visions
But I just can't wait, I just can't wait
No I just can't wait, to fall back to sleep
