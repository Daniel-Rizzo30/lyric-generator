I will collapse
So lets make this moment last
I am alone
No, not because I'm lost
Because I'm found
And I like the way it sounds when I'm at home
Don't say that I can't do it on my own

Then you did collide
And broke through the other side straight to my heart, You're the ember to my flame when it gets dark
And I love the way it feels when I'm with you
And I cannot find the words, no

Two-hundred thirty paces to my place to my place
Oh, I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down
No need for walls now
When I'm with you, I'm at home

Two-hundred thirty paces to my place
Oh, I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down
No need for walls now
Because when I'm with you
I feel like I'm right at home
Two-hundred thirty paces to my place
Oh, I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down
No need for walls now
When I'm with you
I'm at home, home, home

I'm at home, home, home
I'm at home
