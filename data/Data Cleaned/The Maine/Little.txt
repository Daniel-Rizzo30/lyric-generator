It hit me today
Wherever you are is just where you're at
Not where you'll always be
So wherever you are in the world
I want you to be there
And only there
Please know that life would be shit without you
I feel all sorts of good just thinking about you
I mean it when I say it
I genuinely hope you find whatever it is you're looking for
Even if you have to find it alone
