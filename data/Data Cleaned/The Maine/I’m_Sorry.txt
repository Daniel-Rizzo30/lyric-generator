I'm fucked up again
I shouldn't drive tonight, but
I keep thinking of you
I hurt you again
I shouldn't lie tonight
So the next few words are true

Never again, never again, no
Will I leave you high and
Never again, never again, no
Never again, never again, no
Will I leave you high and dry
This time, I more than mean it

I'm sorry, I'm not what you wanted
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I let you down and
I could use some poor excuse
Cause the hardest thing to say
It's the hardest thing to say in the world
I'm sorry, Yeah, I'm sorry

Yeah I'm messed up again
Thinking about the times
I was lost and you let me in
And I'm only human, both you and
I know the way this will end
