She's 18 and a beauty queen (Beauty queen)
She makes the boys feel so weak (So weak)
It's all for her, not at all
She'll pick you up just to watch you fall
It's her hands on my hips, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lips, try not to taste 'em

That's just the way things are, and the way they'll always be

Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can

She's 18 and a beauty queen (Beauty queen)
She's figured out all the boys like me
Head to toe you know she's dressed to kill (Dressed to kill)
And she could the way she's looking at me
It's her face and those eyes, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lies, try not to taste 'em
That's just the way things are, and the way they'll always be

Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can

(That's just the way things are)

Because the boys are feeling jealous
And it just doesn't make any sense
Go on and tell 'em why the girls are into fellas
That toss them to the side in the end
And you know that all the
The boys are falling in love
With the girls who don't know what's up
I think we've all had enough of this now
These kids are talking 'bout love
We think we've all had enough
We've had enough of this now
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
