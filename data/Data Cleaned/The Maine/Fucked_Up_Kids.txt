There's a crowd inside, free in spirit
Nothing dazzling in appearance
We do the best with
With what we have
No, no, no
We aren't models, we aren't actors
We are those who sit up in the rafters
After all, that's where
You will find the action

We're searching
For something
Just trying
To make it happen
We listen
To no one
Don't forget we won't forgive
They'll write a story of the lives we lived

Fucked up Kids

There's a place for you and all my friends
When the sun falls down
A new day begins
Where feeling good is good enough
Take a left on College Avenue
And call your friends they can all come too
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
Me, you
We're searching
For something
Just trying
To make it happen
We listen
To no one
Don't forget we won't forgive
They'll write a story of the lives we lived

Fucked up Kids
Fucked up Kids

I am alone
But I'm not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
I prefer to do things on my own
And even though nobody knows me
No I'm not lonely
No I'm raw, and invincible
We are alone
But we're not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
We prefer to do things on our own
And even though nobody knows it
No we're not lonely
No we're raw, and invincible
We are alone
But we're not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
We prefer to do things on our own
And even though nobody knows it
No we're not lonely
No we're raw, and invincible
