She said, "Let it slide"
All the things that I have running through my mind
Will all be gone in time
Remember son
All the things you've done
And all the things you lost
And all the things you've won

We're just trying to find some color in this
Black and white world

Tell me everything
Will be alright
Walk this way with me
Into the light
Because you can let it slide
Baby just for tonight
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes

She said, "Take your time
Things will be just fine
Don't bite the hand that feeds
Because nothing is ever mine
And just wait your turn
And always try to learn
To love the ones that don't show love in return"


When you're walking backwards
Don't be afraid to close your eyes
Because the truth is, darling
That everything will be alright
Alright?

Tell me everything (Tell me anything)
Walk this way with me (Please tell me everything)
Because you can let it slide
Baby just for tonight
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes


Oh yeah, everyone feels cheated sometimes
Yeah we all feel a little fucked up sometimes
