(Whoa)
Let’s talk all about the way
The way your mouth moves
When you
Try to speak honestly
You’re fluent in faking things

What do you look (What do you look)
What do you look like
When you lie

Maybe it’s that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
Off that two-bit tongue
When you lie
You can’t keep talking like this
Lips do more than just kiss

Let’s talk about the way
The way we talk (Oh, yeah)
And how you
Gossip on everything
You’re so fluent in tragedy
What do you look (What do you look)
What do you look like
When you lie

I don’t wanna talk
I don’t wanna talk

Maybe it’s that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
Off that two-bit tongue
When you lie
You can’t keep talking like this
Lips do more than just kiss
It’s on your lips, when you’re talking
It’s on your lips, when you lie
You can’t keep talking like this
Lips do more than just, kiss

You mislead
You rewind
On repeat
All of the time
Every word
Every line
On repeat
All of the time
All of the time, yeah
Maybe it’s that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
Off that two-bit tongue
When you lie
You can’t keep talking like this
Lips do more than just kiss
It’s on your lips, when you’re talking
It’s on your lips, when you lie
You can’t keep talking like this
Lips do more than just kiss
