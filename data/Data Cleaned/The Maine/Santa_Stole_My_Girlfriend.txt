It’s Christmas day
I’m alone again
She’s with him now
I’m with my loneliness
She ran away 4 months ago
Left with his sleigh
For the north pole

Please come back home
And leave that fat man alone

Santa, you bitch
Didn't get a damn thing from my Christmas list
All I got was this broken heart
And that’s it
Santa, you bitch
Oh there’s only one thing that I truly wish
I wish my old girl would've never kissed Saint Nick
Would've never kissed Saint Nick

I saw them dancing under mistletoe
Thought it was nothing but I guess I didn't know
(I guess I didn't know)
That there was something going on with them
Santa, you player, I thought we were friends
Please come back home
And leave that fat man alone

Santa, you bitch
Didn't get a damn thing from my Christmas list
All I got was this broken heart
And that’s it
Santa, you bitch
Oh there’s only one thing that I truly wish
I wish my old girl would've never kissed Saint Nick
Would've never kissed Saint Nick

Santa, you bitch
Didn't get a damn thing from my Christmas list
All I got was this broken heart
And that’s it
Santa, you bitch
Oh there’s only one thing that I truly wish
I wish my old girl would've never kissed Saint Nick
Would've never kissed Saint Nick

Santa, you bitch
Didn't get a damn thing from my Christmas list
All I got was this broken heart
And that’s it
Santa, you bitch
Oh there’s only one thing that I truly wish
I wish my old girl would've never kissed Saint Nick
Would've never kissed Saint Nick
