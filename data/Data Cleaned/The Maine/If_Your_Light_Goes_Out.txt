So tell me where do you go
When the hope runs out for a little while?
But you know if you ride on the world
It'll only let you down
Thought I heard someone say
In a cliché once, "Don’t you worry now
It's only just the weight of the world
Not the end of it, you know"

I know after all this time I'm gonna make it
I know after all this time I don’t really have the time, no, no, no
I know after all this time I'm gonna make it
I know after all this time I don't really have the time, no, no, no

It was just yesterday
We'd stay up all night at your mother's house
And talk about the places we'd go
When we up and left this town (Up and left this town)
Yeah, you know that I'll still be around
If your light goes out for a little while
And if you cannot carry the world
You can rest it on me now
(You can rest it on me now)
I know after all this time I'm gonna make it
I know after all this time I don’t really have the time, no, no, no
I know after all this time I’m gonna make it
I know after all this time I don't really have the time, no, no, no

I don’t really have the time, no, no, no
I don't really have the time

So tell me where do you go
When the hope runs out for a little while?
It's only just the weight of the world
Not the end of it, you know

I know after all this time I'm gonna make it
I know after all this time I don’t really have the time, no, no, no
I know after all this time I'm gonna make it
I know after all this time I don't really have the time, no, no, no

I don't really have the time, no, no, no
I don't really have the time, no, no, no
