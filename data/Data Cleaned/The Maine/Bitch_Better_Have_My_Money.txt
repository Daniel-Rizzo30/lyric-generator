Louis XIII, and it's all on me, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
Don't act like you forgot

Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me
And don't act like you forgot
Don't, no

Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my money

Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drop, I am the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Don't act like you forgot
Don't act like you forgot
Don't act like you forgot
Don't, no
Don't, no

No, no
