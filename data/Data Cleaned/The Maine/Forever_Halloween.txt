Just this once
Just for now
You can be anything
In the world
Darling don't
You start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's make believe

Kids in costumes
Dressed like Kings and Queens
Little monsters
Walking down my street
In this place I'll
Be anything but me
So you be brave and
I'll still be eighteen

So just this once
Yeah just for now
Yeah, you can be anything
Anything in the world
And darling don't
Don't you start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's just make believe
Kids in costumes
Dressed for Halloween
Ghosts and goblins
Walking down my street
We're all monsters
Living in a dream
So you be you
And I'll still be happy

Forever Halloween
