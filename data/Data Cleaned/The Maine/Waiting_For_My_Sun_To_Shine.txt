Is this a waste of all my precious time?
And could this chance that I take lead me to losing my mind?
As I step to the edge, I saw the water below
Then I said to myself, "Sometimes you've got to let go"

All I know is
All I know is
All I know is I'm still waiting for my sun to shine

Oh I see our clouds when I look around
Rain falls from my mouth as it hits the ground
Lead me to the light
'Cause I'm still waiting
I'm waiting for my sun to shine

What does it take to be a liar?
And all the chances we take
What we're measured by
As I sat on my couch
I wondered why
It's such a beautiful day
And I'm still sitting inside-side-side
All I know is
All I know is
All I know is I'm still waiting for my sun to shine


I was dancin' with the devil
I was singing dirty songs
Pouring whiskey from the bottle
'Till the early break of dawn
Oh my gorgeous Arizona
Here's to getting caught with you
I was running with the wolves
I was howling at the moon

I felt lonely, lost, and stranded
I felt down and torn apart
With no cash left in my pockets
Just a shitty fortune card
It read, "Strength will find you sooner than you ever thought it would"
Then the pain it turned to anger
Moved to joy so now I'm good
And I'm one pack smokes from broke
I can tell I will make it alone
So I'll keep on fighting
Yeah I'll keep on fighting
In the end, will you sink or will you float?

When you're one pack smokes from broke
When you're one pack smokes from broke
When you're one pack smokes from broke
When you're one pack smokes from broke
I'm just one pack smokes from broke
Yes, I'm one pack smokes from broke
I'm just one pack smokes from broke
I'm just one pack smokes from broke
I'm just one pack smokes from broke
One pack smokes from broke
One pack smokes from broke
I'm just one back smokes from broke

I'm just one pack smokes from broke
