Never really, really ever felt so at home before
Never really ever felt this strange and beautiful
All us boys and all us girls
Turned to diamonds, turned to pearls
And never really, really ever felt so at home before

And I said, "I wanna feel like this forever"
Even if forever's just for now
We're on fire, let us burn
As the outside world, it turns
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
Forevermore
Forevermore

I never really, really ever felt so adored before
Never really ever felt this type of vulnerable
Don't have to hide, don't have to fear
All you have to be is here
And never really, really ever felt so adored before

And I said, "I wanna feel like this forever"
Even if forever's just for now
We're on fire, let us burn
As the outside world, it turns
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
Forevermore
Woo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-ooh, woo!
Woo-hoo-hoo
And I said, I wanna feel like this forever
Well, even if forever's just for now
For now, for now, for now

I wanna feel like this forever
Even if forever's just for now
We're on fire, let us burn
As the outside world, it turns
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
