There’s always a reason
To stay inside your head
But you’ll never make it out
So you found a reason (Give me a reason)
To make believe instead
Now you’re somebody else

But you don’t have to hide your scars
Not from me tonight (At all)

Show me the real you
Misunderstood can feel so good
You don’t have to hide yourself
Pretender, pretender
Show me the real you
Surrender yеah, I wish you would
You don’t have to hide yourself
Prеtender, pretend

That you are an ocean
Strong but delicate
It doesn’t matter where you run
For the next 2 minutes
Pretend that you are infinite (You are infinite)
And the hiding out is done
But you don’t have to hide your scars
No not at all from me tonight (At all)

Show me the real you
Misunderstood can feel so good
You don’t have to hide yourself
Pretender, pretender
Show me the real you
Surrender yeah, I wish you would
You don’t have to hide yourself
Pretender, pretender
Pretender, pretender
You don't have to hide
Pretender, pretender
No, you don't have to hide

We all play roles as people, believe me
We’re lying to ourselves
Don’t belong, you don’t belong at all
You gotta be brave to be here, believe me
I hope you find yourself
Don’t belong
You don’t belong at all
Show me the real you
Misunderstood can feel so good
You don’t have to hide yourself
Pretender, pretender
Show me the real you
Surrender yeah, I wish you would
You don’t have to hide yourself
Pretender, pretender

Pretender, pretender
You don't have to hide from me no more
Pretender, pretender
No, you don't have to hide
Pretender, pretender
Pretender, pretender
