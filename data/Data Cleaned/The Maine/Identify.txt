Some things are out of my hands
I'm what time and consequence have made me
Sit back and watch the world explode
3, 2, 1 here come the fireworks baby
Sometimes you can feel so smart
Just like a ghost in school clothes
But my days are mostly hazy
3, 2, 1 here comes the hurricane baby

Yeeaaah identify
Identify
(If I am not a man, what am I then?)
Yeaaah identify identify
(My head, my hands are all I really have)
Don't stand in line, identify

Yeeaaah, I bought the last plane ticket to the end of the world
Who ever says that the good die young?
All the boys are alive
All the boys are with girls
Time to give them what they're waiting for
If the drugs don't work then you probably need more [2x]
Time to give them what they're waiting for
Yeaaah identify, identify
(I'm the 88 snake that you love to hate)
Yeaaah identify, identify
(My tongue, my teeth are what you're going to taste)
Don't stand in line
No don't stand in line identify, identify
