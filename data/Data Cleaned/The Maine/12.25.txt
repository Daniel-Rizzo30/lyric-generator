Snow falls in the quiet city
While a fire burns inside
And I'm wrapped up in a feeling
Got you wrapped up in my mind

All is calm, all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
Twelve twenty-five
Twelve twenty-five

I've got a list that's full of wishes
And every single one's for you
And in the stillness took the list and crossed it, babe
You're the sleigh, the bells, the song on your side too

All is calm, all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
Twelve twenty-five
And all is calm, and all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
Yeah all is calm, and all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
