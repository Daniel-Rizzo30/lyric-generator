With my miserable youth

All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well, these threads are so old

See, darlin' dear, you don't need high-priced designs

All done up in my hand-me-down clothes

See, darlin' dear, you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up (to feel dressed up)
Oh, no, you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up to the nines
