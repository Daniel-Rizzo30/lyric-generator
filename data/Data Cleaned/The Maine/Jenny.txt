Before I go
Please know I'm trying
Trying to be a better man
Before I leave
Please don't get angry
Just dry your eyes and take my hand

I'll make this right
Oh, I will try
Jenny don't you cry
Close your eyes
Everything is going to  be alright
You're so young and still so free
Jenny take my hand
Understand
I will try to be a better man
Without you there is no me
Jenny

There is a boy inside me running
From a man I've yet to meet
I see his face it only scares me
I hope things change eventually
