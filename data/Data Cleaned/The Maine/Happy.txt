I don't think I am capable of
This teenage televised taping of love
But here is my guide
On how to be alone
Just act like a freak
And sleep with everyone you've ever known

I'm half-crazy
All just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
I'm sad, funny
It seems lately
This ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy

I'd like to think
Romance is real
Open my chest
A heart you could steal
But here is my guide
On how to stay alone
Just drink till your gone, and pass out on the floor
I'm half-crazy
All just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
I'm sad, funny
It seems lately
This ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy

I'm half-crazy
All just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
I'm sad, funny
It seems lately
This ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy
