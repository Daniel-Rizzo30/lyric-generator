I walk the tight rope
On my way home
You're my backbone
I know you're somewhere close behind me

I walk the fault line
In a dirty field in the springtime
I feel the wind start to remind me
Of you (you)
And the sweet talk
On the sidewalk
It's true (true)
All know is

All we have is what's left today
Hearts so pure in this broken place
Because we are, we are, we are
Who we are, we are, we are
Lovers lost in space
We're searching for our saving grace

And I still remember
How your lips taste
On holidays
You leave in December
What can I do to make you stay?
Because we won't fade away
We'll find peace while other change
And I know you're somewhere close behind me
And it's true (true)
Oh, the sweet sound in the background
It's you (you)
All I know is

Oh yeah
We're searching for our saving grace
Oh yeah
Keep on searching, keep on searching
Keep, keep, keep, keep

I walk the tightrope
You're my way home
You're my backbone
You'll always be here right beside me
