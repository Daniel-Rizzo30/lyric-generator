When I see your face
It’s like I hit rewind
Because you’re on repeat
Just like “so good” in “Sweet Caroline”
I want to put you on
Like a 45
And I’ll watch you spin
Until the sunrise

With the windows closed
I hear your heartbeat echo
I feel the same rush all over
For the first time all over again

And I swear
These days
You’ve been stuck in my brain
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
Back to that summer soundtrack
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
And over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over
Sticky just like the song in my head

And I’ve made mistakes
But you were not one
And I finally found those letters lost
Under my tongue
And I hear your name
In every single line
Of every single song I’ve ever heard and I
Still feel the same
I can’t shake you now

And I swear
These days
You’ve been stuck in my brain
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
Back to that summer soundtrack
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
These days
You’ve been stuck in my brain
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
Back to that summer soundtrack
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head

And over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over
Sticky just like the song in my head
And over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over
Sticky just like the song in my head

And I swear
These days
You’ve been stuck in my brain
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
Back to that summer soundtrack
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
These days
You’ve been stuck in my brain
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
Back to that summer soundtrack
Want to play you
Over and over again
Sticky just like the song in my head
