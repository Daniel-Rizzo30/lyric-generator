I'm feeling pretty dirty baby
Forgive my sins
I get the feeling you can save me honey
My heroine

Your hips, my hands, you swing and you dance
Yea, I'm feeling pretty lonely baby
Just let me in
Just let me in

You're my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

I feel a little withdrawal baby
Come pick me up
Took a hit from your level
Now I just can't get enough
Your taste, my touch
A little bit of love and a whole lot of lust
I'm feeling pretty lonely baby
So just let me in
Just let me in
You're my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

Dada dadada da da da da
Dada dadada da da da da
Dada dadada da da da da
Dada dadada da da da da

Your hips, my hands, you swing and you dance
I'm feeling pretty lonely baby
So just let me in

You're my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

You're my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine
