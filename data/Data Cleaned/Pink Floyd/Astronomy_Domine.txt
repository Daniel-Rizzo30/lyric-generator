"Moon in both [houses]..." 
"...Scorpio, [Arabian Skies], Libra..." 
"...Pluto was not discovered until 1930..."

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten


Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare who’s there?

Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground
