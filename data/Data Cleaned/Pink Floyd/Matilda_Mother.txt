Oh, Mother
Tell me more

Why’d'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did

For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh, Mother
Tell me more
Tell me more

Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
