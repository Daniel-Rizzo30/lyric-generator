And the ripped ones say goodbye
While the others meet
Attached somewhere
At least they're shared
And the ripped ones never collide
While the others, while the others
While the others...
Four
(And the ripped ones say goodbye)
Nine, Five
(While the others meet)
Three
(Attached somewhere)
One
(At least they're shared)
Four
(And the ripped ones never collide)
Nine, Five
(While the others)
Three
(While the others)
One
(While the others)
Four, nine, five, three, one
Four, nine, five, three, one
Four, nine, five, three, one
