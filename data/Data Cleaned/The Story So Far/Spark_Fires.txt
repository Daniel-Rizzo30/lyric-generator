Who knows how much time is left
And I always want what I can't get
But it calms my nerves, and it helps me learn
That I can stand beside my best friends
And laugh untill the very end
Spark fires with lighters and blaze where no one can find us
Keep myself sane for one more day

And maybe when I'm older
I'll give up shrug my shoulders
And watch myself become like the rest
But youth is till my best bet
Nostalgic till my last breath
It's something that you can't understand

Call me crazy but we've conquered our fears
And we reject the self obsession that we see in our peers
So when the curtain falls and all of you
Are left with your years
Well still be standing recommending that you
Look in the mirror

At something other than yourself
I hope your happy with your wealth
Cause I'm walking through your front door
I said I'm walking through your front door
Just like I did when we were so young
I'm practically begging you to come back home
Whoah oh oh oh
