I bet it hurts to read "permanence"
I used to think on all of this
And how you don't
Damn, it's hard to find sustenance
When all I had was love for this
And now you don't
Now I just abuse substances
To drown out your accomplishments
However few

All of this frustrates me bad
'Cause I can't stay mad
At you or change anything that I had
She told me, "Don't think like that
It's really not that bad"
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad

If it's something serious then hit me up
But until then, the door is shut
Forget my room
And if I had a match for every lie
And every attempt to deny
I'd strike a few
I am the walls, the silent halls
My jacket at your sister's wedding
Navy blue
All of this frustrates me bad
'Cause I can't stay mad
At you or change anything that I had
She told me, "Don't think like that
It's really not that bad"
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad
