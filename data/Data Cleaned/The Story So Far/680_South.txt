"680 South"

My thoughts are my doctor's excuse for medicine
But I find it healthy to get lost inside my head
Come back with all that I can I find
Write it down on light blue lines
It's far more usual than reading the Contra Costa Times
55 up YV road, Encina on my left
All you tried and failed to do was justify your theft
And I guess that your bereft of other things to occupy yourself
But keep my goddamn name out of your mouth
(Your just a shade of gray)

And all I want is forward progress
Maybe next year I'll miss your face but right now it is still worthless
Wasted time, mostly mine
It's not my fucking fault so
Get lost and find your way home
(Get lost and find your way home)
Get lost and find your way home

(Leave my mind alone)
So I can rate and number my thoughts 1-2-3
On a list that weighs and measures my priorities
It goes: 1. Friends 2. Bands 3. That Green Two-Tone Van
And I'm losing my money it's not about money
And all I want is forward progress
Maybe next year I'll miss your face but right now it is still worthless
Wasted time, mostly mine
It's not my fucking fault so
Get lost and find your way home
(Get lost and find your way home)
Get lost and find your way home

And all I got was a blank stare
Right between the eyes like i wasn't there
And all I got was a blank stare
Right between the eyes like i wasn't there
