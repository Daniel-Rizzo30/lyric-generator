Well, he feels like an elephant
Shakin' his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about
Being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it’s not like Mister Shook to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily scared

He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now
Coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing
When they saw him again
That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)
