Outer space is the only place to hide now
From whoever wants to know where you are
Everything is easier than ever
When we fall baby we fall so hard

First conferred when the primates tried to warn me
When Adam ran off to make a fire
Mother Nature whispered to the apes now
We'll rebuild this place when they are gone

I was just another one
Waiting for the bees to come
I was Mother Nature's son
But I was just another one
Just another one
Oh
