You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh


Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you
Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you
