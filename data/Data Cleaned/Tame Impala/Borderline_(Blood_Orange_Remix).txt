Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the Sun
Here comes the Sun
Ah, ah, ah

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
