Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion

My guessing game is strong
Now that I know what's on
High like amphetamine
Maybe it's just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm waking up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion
It must have been an illusion
It must have been a confusion
