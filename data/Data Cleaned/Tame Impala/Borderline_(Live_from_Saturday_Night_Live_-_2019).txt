Pollinate your love, pollinate your love
It's time for somethin'
I was in for long
I was in for long at night for some thing

We're on the borderline
On the borrowed time we wasted one day
Possibly a sign
Gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A
Asking how I managed to end up
In this place
And I couldn't get away

I'm on the borderline, caught between the tides
Of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time, watched it speeding by
Like a train… like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Is it closer? Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without

Will I be known and loved?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun

Pollinate your love, pollinate your love
It's time for somethin'
I said
"Can we go outside?" Need to bottle lies
And wait for somethin'

Do you see the light? Do you wonder why
They ain't respondin'?
Mexico in sight, oh, as we go inside
Oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline, gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can, once again I am
Alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known in love?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one?  That I trust
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without

Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun
