I was trying to resolve and I’m waiting
It felt natural
Oh, I was hoping it would come out right
Who was I kidding

Push the button and start counting down
Oh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose
Control
I concur
With the doubt
But I can’t
Turn back round
And they trip
What’s beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on

Now let’s do this right
Everybody
(And I’ll be trying)
It won’t come out right
I can fold
I can lose
Control
I can lose
Control
I can face
The unknown
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail
I don’t care

(Now let’s do this right)
There’s so much
Left unclear
But it’s time
Taxi’s here
