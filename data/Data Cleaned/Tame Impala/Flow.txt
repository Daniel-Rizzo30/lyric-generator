Well, the air is still but we are moving
I like the wind so wind the windows down

Oh!
See my flow
So we all

And now come back down again
Makes me wonder how I ever felt so good

Oh!
So alone
Feel it all
Flows down
Oh!


I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Wake me when you're done
Let me feel your flow
Feel my flow
Feel at home
Feel alone
