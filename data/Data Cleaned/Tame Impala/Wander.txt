Save your fragile mama's heart
And while she will come for you
But I wander

And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know her

Feel just like I need to be
Back where I was before
I couldn't go back
But I wander

And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know


How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)

And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking tough so easily
For hours on end, I wander
(Ooh)

How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (And I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me (Just how far will you need to be)
How it keeps a lid on me (For shaking tough so easily)
How it keeps a lid on me (For hours on end I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
