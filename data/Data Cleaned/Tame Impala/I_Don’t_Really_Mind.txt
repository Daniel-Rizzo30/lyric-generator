Shifting, shifting, shifting a lot
Like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around
Like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine-tenths of the time

But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind

Childhood puppy is old and gruff
Your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed
Three weeks ago today

But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind

But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
