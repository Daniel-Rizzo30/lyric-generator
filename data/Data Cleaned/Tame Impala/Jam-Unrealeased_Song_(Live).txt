How you gonna let me know?
When the moment comes to show you
What we like to talk about
Listen to me, (?) just where
I know

Where you’ll be

Just when I might come on running
Just when I might come around
I know you won’t be wondering where I’ve been half the time
No word of reassurances from the other side
So I wonder if I did it right
