Now that all these walls are down
Wonder what I'll tell you

You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

Count the number of things you are
See how long it takes you

You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh!


You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh
Oh
