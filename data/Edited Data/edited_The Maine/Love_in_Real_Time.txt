so welcome to my intoxicated mind
all up in real time
i've never felt so comfortable inthemiddle of thesummertime
(summertime)

working on our love in realtime
making all this love in real time
i'm falling more and more in love in real time
(i need somebody like you, i'm falling)
working on our love in real time
(i need somebody like you, i'm falling)
love in real time
