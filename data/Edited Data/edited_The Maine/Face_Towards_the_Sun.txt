after i'm gone, your earth will be free to live out its miserable span of existence
as one of my satellites
and that's how it's going to be

when the call came down
well, my tears fell out under the midday sun
and i just hope you felt no pain at all
dressed in your best
one last deep breath
as you turn towards the sun

i remember that
empty chapel and the sound of "barbara ann"
it just goes to show, goes to show
there's no sense at all
in making plans 'cause god don't carе about our plans
yeah, in the end timе will find us all
dressed in our best
one last deep breath
as we turn towards the sun
towards the sun
towards the sun
(take it out, take it out, take it out)
towards the sun
(take it out, take it out, take it out)
everything is exactly as it should be
exactly as it should be
everything is exactly as it should be
exactly as it should be
everything is exactly as it should be
exactly as it should be
everything is exactly as it should be

yeah, i just hope you felt no pain at all
no pain at all
i just hope you felt no pain at all
no pain at all
as you turn towards the sun
towards the sun
towards the sun
towards the sun
towards the sun
