wake up, it's am
you fell in love again
something wrong with living life like this
at work can't help but stare
long legs and her dark brown hair
you give her a smile and that's it
the store it's pm
you see her face again
you catch her eye
you panic and walk towards her
can't think of what to say
no words come up today
so you just smile
and it's goodbye

you say "so what"
(you say "so what")
i fell in love but it just won't work because
(just won't work because)

i fell in love again
don't know how it happened
she slipped away again
the same as last weekend
oh it's a routine thing
just with some new feelings
i always choke up when
i get close to closing in
so i stare straight into the mirror
hope i find something there
if not i know
i'll get shot straight back down
i dress up real nice
make sure my hair's right
write down a few lines
to tell her that i love her



and i'll make her mine
the one i sing about all the time
because she's in my dreams
but it's never as real as
as real as it seems
and i'm going to need
a lot more than hope
and maybe you'll be my baby
or maybe not
because i'm all choked up

i get close to closing in
