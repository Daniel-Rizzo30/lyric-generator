turn it up, it's my song
i can't sing, but i'll sing along
yeah, i can feel it in my bones
a little rock, a little roll

take it fast, take it slow
let me tell you something that you don't know
well the bars are all closed
and we got no place to go
but we're all a little drunk
and we wanna hear some rock and roll

is anybody listening? no
where did that old feeling go?
don't stop listening to rock and roll

another round to the sound of that mojo music
muddy waters said we got it so we might as well use it
i asked katie to dance and i almost blew it
i only kissed her on the mouth 'cause he told me to do it

is anybody listening? no
where did that old feeling go?
don't stop listening to rock and roll
is anybody listening? no
where did that old feeling go?
don't stop listening to rock and roll
don't stop listening to rock and roll
don't stop listening to rock and roll
don't stop listening to rock and roll

what does it take to be alive?
and all the chances we take
what we're measured by?
i sat on my couch and wondered why
it's such a beautiful day; i'm still sitting inside
all i know is i'm still waiting for my sun to shine
