photograph, remembering the summer
it takes me back
to southern california
where the girls would all pass
on the boardwalk and laugh
at our desperate attempts and our sunburned backs
we never had a chance, i remember that
and no matter what we do
we'll never lose what we had

growing up won't bring us down
growing up, it won't bring us down
growing up won't bring us down[x]

graduate, what's a kid to do now?
get away, yeah-ah
we've got so much to prove
because it's time to move on
and i'm stuck to let go
but then wonderwall comes on the radio
i flashback to the night in your parent's yard
when we drank too much and we talked about god
growing up, won't bring us down
growing up, it won't bring us down
we're in this together
yeah, we'll make it somehow
nothing's going to stop us now
growing up won't bring us down[x]
oh-oh-oh

photograph, oh give me something to remember


growing up won't bring us down
