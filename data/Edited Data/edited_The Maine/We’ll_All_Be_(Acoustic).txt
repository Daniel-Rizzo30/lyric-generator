surrounded by familiar faces
the people that you love to see
where everybody knows your name, and they're smiling
we may not be getting younger
our days might be slipping away
yeah we're still so fucking young
so we'll party like it's our last day

and for the first time, i feel less alone
and for the first time, i can call this home

it's our last time to say goodnight
don't say goodbye, 'cause in the morning we'll
we'll see you around
and we'll sing it again
same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in

i'm ashamed of feeling down now
cause we're the people we've been waiting on
all we needed was some good friends
and a song to sing a long
with voices yelling in the front room
no one could tell us, "keep it down"
so we all just kept it loud, and tried to wake the entire town
and for the first time, i feel less alone
and for the first time, i can call this home

it's our last time to say goodnight
don't say goodbye, 'cause in the morning we'll
we'll see you around
yeah we'll sing it again
same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in
it's our last time to say goodnight
don't say goodbye, 'cause in the morning we'll
we'll see you around
yeah we'll sing it again
same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in

these days are numbered, but we can't forget last summer
when we sang and threw our arms into the air
go on and sing it out
our days are numbered, and we know we're not getting younger
but it's nights like these that make you not really care
these days are numbered, but we can't forget last summer
(we all have been degraded)
when we sang and threw our arms into the air
(we all have been the greatest)
go on and sing it out
our days are numbered, and we know we're not getting younger  (we all have been degraded)
but it's nights like these that make you not really care
(we all will be the greatest)
