(tell me how to feel like we did...)

tell me how to feel like we did
when we were young
oh, you would take the wheel
oh yeah we were on the run
and i remember nights
we would sing 'till we saw the sun
oh, just tell me how to feel like we did
when we we're young
so young

yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song
and all my friends, oh they were singing along
we got down, we got high
oh, the moment felt so right
so let's run free and carry on
like we did when we were young

we turn the music loud
when we drive right through the town
but we roll the windows down
so the cops won't come around
t-t-take me to the time
when things were fine, it's all broken now
but always keep in mind, things are fine
and we'll figure it out
yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song
and all my friends, oh they were singing along
we got down, we got high
oh, the moment felt so right
so let's run free and carry on
like we did when we were young
like we did when we were young

tell me how to feel like we did when we were young
oh, just tell me how to feel like we did when we were young
young, young, so young...

yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song
and all my friends, oh they were singing along
we got down, we got high
oh, the moment felt so right
so let's run free and carry on
like we did when we were young
like we did when we were young
oh, so young
like we did when we were young
