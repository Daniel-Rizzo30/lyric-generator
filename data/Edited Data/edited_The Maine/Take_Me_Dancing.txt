oh a good man said
"if you're feeling dead
you got to try to find a way to be alive"
this is not a game
that you have to play
don't need a reason to breathe
just like you die

give me thunder, give me lightning
and i will give you every part of me
take me dancing, get me fucked up
play that old guitar an we will sing

oh my old man said
"you must lay in your bed
the way you make it, no one can make it like you do"
oh you're not alone
you still have a home
no matter what you do, my son, i'm still proud of you


yeah, we'll sing

yeah, we'll sing
we'll sing
