it's funny how, this bad taste in my mouth only lasts till i spit it out
i was wasted my mind was racing all throughout our conversation
kris didn't say too much, her face did quite enough
as the blood ran from her nose
as the blood ran from her nose
oh

what are we doing here?

kristina, please don't come here anymore
kristina
oh it's not me, it's you
i only did it because i wanted to

it's funny how this bad taste in my mouth last
until i forget about how it feels to feel this way feels like just the other day
when we were kids, never thought it'd come to this laugh then you take a hit
oh, you look so criminal, i feel just like a criminal
oh

what the fuck am i doing here?
kristina, please don't come here anymore
kristina
oh it's not me, it's you
i only did it because i wanted to

i cannot wait to see your face when you come crawling back to me
i cannot wait to see your face when you come crawling back to me
i cannot wait to see your face when you come crawling back to me

kristina, please don't come here anymore
kristina
oh it's not me, it's you
i only did it because i wanted to
