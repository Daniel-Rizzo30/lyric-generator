(whoa)
lets talk all about the way
the way your mouth moves
when you
try to speak honestly
youre fluent in faking things

what do you look (what do you look)
what do you look like
when you lie

maybe its that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
off that two-bit tongue
when you lie
you cant keep talking like this
lips do more than just kiss

lets talk about the way
the way we talk (oh, yeah)
and how you
gossip on everything
youre so fluent in tragedy
what do you look (what do you look)
what do you look like
when you lie

i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna talk

maybe its that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
off that two-bit tongue
when you lie
you cant keep talking like this
lips do more than just kiss
its on your lips, when youre talking
its on your lips, when you lie
you cant keep talking like this
lips do more than just, kiss

you mislead
you rewind
on repeat
all of the time
every word
every line
on repeat
all of the time
all of the time, yeah
maybe its that loose-lipped way you make your words roll
off that two-bit tongue
when you lie
you cant keep talking like this
lips do more than just kiss
its on your lips, when youre talking
its on your lips, when you lie
you cant keep talking like this
lips do more than just kiss
