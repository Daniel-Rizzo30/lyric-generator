angels with dirty faces
darkness begins to take me tonight

good friends, bad habits
in the end we're all tragic
so why?

i can't go on like this forever

i started to run, i put down the gun
oh i'm learning to be free
looked up at the sky, started to fly
it feels better to be me
no you can't take nothing from me
cause i'm free

wake up and move forward
shake off that cold shoulder tonight
relapse you're walking backwards
relax forget your problems tonight


i'm free and i breathe
so the change is up to you
to be free and release
all the shit you used to do
