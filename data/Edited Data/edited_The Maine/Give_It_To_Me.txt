the way you're moving
across the floor
don't have to say it
you want some more
give me some more, more, more[x]
i want some more

give me what i want
give me all you got
give it to me (woah, woah)
give me what i want
give me all you got
give it to me (woah, woah)
just give it to me

tired of playing
i'm getting bored
no need to say it
i want some more
give me some more, more, more
because i'm getting bored, bored, bored
give me some more

you got your daddy's wallet
and your mothers eyes
soon enough girl you're going to realize
that when the pretty boys try to get next to you
they really just want to have sex with you
it's the way you move
and the clothes you wear
the alcohol and the way that you don't care
all i want to do is get next to you
next to you, next to you

that sinful stare
your poison kiss
like satan's daughter's holy lips


oh, just give it to me (woah, woah)
oh darling, give it to me (woah, woah)
oh baby, give it to me (woah, woah)
go on and give it to me (woah, woah
