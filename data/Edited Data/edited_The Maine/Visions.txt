last night i saw you in a dream
i'm still not sure just what it means
two nights before much of the same
i found you dancing on the back of my brain

hallucinating things are fine in my head
illuminating the right side of my bed

and we kissed and we fought
i laughed and you screamed
oh i've learned to loathe these
goddamn visions
but i just can't wait to fall back to sleep

oh i woke up and i felt let down
you tied up your sliver hair and left this town
you're three hundred something miles away
i close my eyes and all i see is your face

hallucinating things are fine in my head
illuminating the right side of my bed
and we kissed and we fought
i laughed and you screamed
oh i've learned to loathe these
goddamn visions
but i just can't wait to fall back to sleep

hallucinating

and we kissed and we fought
i laughed and you screamed
oh i've learned to loathe these
goddamn visions
but i just can't wait, i just can't wait
no i just can't wait, to fall back to sleep
