i don't think i am capable of
this teenage televised taping of love
but here is my guide
on how to be alone
just act like a freak
and sleep with everyone you've ever known

i'm half-crazy
all just cracked up
when will what i have ever be good enough?
i'm sad, funny
it seems lately
this ain't a fairytale
and i don't think i'll ever be
happy

i'd like to think
romance is real
open my chest
a heart you could steal
but here is my guide
on how to stay alone
just drink till your gone, and pass out on the floor
i'm half-crazy
all just cracked up
when will what i have ever be good enough?
i'm sad, funny
it seems lately
this ain't a fairytale
and i don't think i'll ever be
happy

i'm half-crazy
all just cracked up
when will what i have ever be good enough?
i'm sad, funny
it seems lately
this ain't a fairytale
and i don't think i'll ever be
happy
