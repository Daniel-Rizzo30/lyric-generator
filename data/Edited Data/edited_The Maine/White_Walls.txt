here's to this breath
and the one i hope we take next
it hurts to know
the hardest part
it hasn't come yet

oh please try to remind me just who you are
', just a child and his four white walls
now that boy is a man
i don't know who i am

i'm just a kid
don't walk away
(please don't walk away)
i don't think i'll make it through today
(if you walk away)
please don't walk away

here's to this love
we didn't earn, yet we're taking
to the same love
that's  years in the making
with a thousand more to come
oh please try to remind me just who you are
 a child and his four white walls
now that boy is a man
i don't know who i am

i'm just a kid
don't walk away
(please don't walk away)
i don't think i'll make it through today
(if you walk away)
please don't walk away

i'm just a kid
don't walk away
(please don't walk away)
i don't think i'll make it through today
(if you walk away)
please don't walk away

we bleed the same blood
you and me
we bleed the same blood
the way that the river runs through
i bleed for you
we bleed the same blood
you and me
we bleed the same blood
the way that the river runs through
i bleed for you
we bleed the same blood
you and me
we bleed the same blood
the way that the river runs through
i bleed for you
we bleed the same blood
you and me
we bleed the same blood
the way that the river runs through
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
