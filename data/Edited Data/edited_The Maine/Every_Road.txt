oh, it's safe to say i knew it
yeah, i knew it all along
asking the same questions
singing the same songs
i've been gone for a while
been traveling alone
searching for a new life
when i already had my own

so i walk back home
on every road

on every road
we cross alone
we're thinking of those we left back home
so follow the lines
and i'll be your guide
because we're the lucky ones
(on every road)

yeah, it's safe to say i knew
that all the selfish things i do
would eventually come creeping back around
way back when
you called me young
said we're innocent and dumb
i knew that you'd come creeping back around again
