i really should just go home
and play with myself
better that than stay
and do something else
because we can't be friends
that much i know
i wish it wasn't so
and i can't take my heart some place it won't go
show me to the door

as if a plane crash were timely
there's no good time for bad news
these four words don't come easy
i don't love you

so listen to your friends and leave me alone
i'm just a boy, i'm drunk, i'm 
i don't want to hurt you anymore
don't waste your tears on me, now pretty girl
when i hate myself for letting you go
you can be the one to say i told you so

as if a plane crash were timely
there's no good time for bad news
these four words don't come easy
i don't love you
as if a plane crash were timely
there's no good time for bad news
these four words don't come easy
i don't love you
