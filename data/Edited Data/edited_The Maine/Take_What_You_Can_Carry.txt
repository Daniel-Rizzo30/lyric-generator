you get what you pay for
unless you take a little more
what's the delay for?
ain't nothing but a thunderstorm

find a new angle
you and me we'll start a war
or you'll get what you paid for

take what you can carry
joseph and mary
they're out of town tonight

well you get what you pay for
the shiny things on silver screens
the media, celebrities
what's the delay for?
take what you want
not what you need
just take
and take and take
take, take
take what you can carry
joseph and mary
they're out of town tonight
my children will be shining
covered in diamonds
if you see me don't put up a fight
or you'll get what you paid for
yeah you'll get what you paid for

take what you can carry
joseph and mary
they're out of town tonight
my children will be shining
covered in diamonds
you better hope you don't see me

take what you can carry
joseph and mary
they're out of town tonight
my children will be shining
covered in diamonds
if you see me don't put up a fight
or you'll get what you paid for
yeah you'll get what you paid for
