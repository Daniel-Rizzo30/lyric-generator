what will you do on the weekends
when your best friends become your dead friends?
from all the sugar and all the sweetness
this little sweet tooth, it is your weakness

they've got american candy
(you're sweet and sated, so sedated)
for the american kids
(you're hooked and baited, annihilated)
and even if you wanted to
you couldn't stop, it's just so sweet
but this american candy
it'll rot your teeth

try to think back to, back to a time when
(you loved what you loved because)
you loved what you loved because you loved it
(before the sugar and the)
before the sugar and all the sweetness
(lungs all filled up with sweetness)
filled up your lungs now, it's all you breath in

they've got american candy
(you're sweet and sated, so sedated)
for the american kids
(you're hooked and baited, annihilated)
and even if you wanted to
you couldn't stop, it's just so sweet
but this american candy
oh, it'll rot your teeth, your teeth, your teeth
sometimes i feel as though i'm going mad when
i get a touch of saccharine on my lips
i hate the taste on my tongue, too damn sweet
i don't fancy american candy, american candy

they've got american candy
(you're sweet and sated, so sedated)
for the american kids
(you're hooked and baited, annihilated)
and even if you wanted to
you couldn't stop, it's just so sweet
but this american candy
oh, it'll rot your teeth until your gums, they bleed

i hate the taste on my tongue, too damn sweet
i don't fancy american candy
oh, you're so sweet and sated, baby
i hate the taste on my tongue, too damn sweet
i don't fancy american candy
