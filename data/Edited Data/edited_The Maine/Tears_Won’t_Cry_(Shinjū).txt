(whoo!)
(whoo!)

tell me what you think about
lovers leaving this evening
(with the blood red moon)
sex and freedom, shelter and
(sweet endings, too)
disappearing like a thought
(our forbidden truth)
disappear, never get caught

dream with both eyes open
we can slip away
our escape in motion
now i'm wide awake
save your tears for something
worth crying over babe
dont waste them on misfortune
darling, break away to a place they won't cry
baby, they won't cry today

just like a secret lovers suicide
kiss off into the sky
to a mystic place where tears won't cry
we'll borrow happiness just for the night
where all our tears won't cry
oh and nothing can hurt you (whoo!)
(whoo!)
(whoo!)
tell me what you think about
me and you and valentine
(and desire too)
safe and sound in paradise
(just me and you)
no sense in trying to hide
(oh, it found me, too)
our lust and our wild eyes

dream with both eyes open
we can slip away
our escape in motion
now i'm wide awake
save your tears for something
worth crying over babe
don't waste them on misfortune
darling, break away to a place they won't cry
baby, they won't cry today (whoo!)

just like a secret lovers suicide
kiss off into the sky
to a mystic place where tears wont cry
we'll borrow happiness just for the night
where all our tears wont cry
oh, and nothing can hurt you (whoo!)
just like a secret lovers' suicide
'til death do us unite
in a mystic place where tears won't cry
well borrow happiness just for the night
where all our tears won't cry
oh, and nothing can hurt you (whoo!)
tell me what you think about
tell me what you think about
tell me what you think about
tell me what you think about

just like a secret lovers' suicide
kiss off into the sky
to a mystic place where tears won't cry
we'll borrow happiness just for the night
where all our tears won't cry
oh and nothing can hurt you (whoo!)
just like a secret lovers' suicide
'til death do us unite
in a mystic place where tears won't cry
we'll borrow happiness just for the night
