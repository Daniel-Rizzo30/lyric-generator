hello world
hello sun
man on the moon
man on the run

it's taking town
it's moving slow
my whiskey's straight
your whiskey cold

and i said
hello world, hello world
hello world, hello world
wherever you come from

let's take a trip
you can come along
we'll take a sip
we'll sing a song

let's take it down
all nice and slow
your whiskey's straight
and my whiskey cold

and i said
hello world, hello world
hello world, hello world
wherever you come from
hello world, hello world
hello world, hello something

hello world, hello world
hello world, hello world
wherever you come from

hello, hello, hello, hello
