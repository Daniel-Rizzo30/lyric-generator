you count them one, two three
you look so cute when you get that mad
you drain the life from me and it feels oh so good

the looks you give are so contagious
the way we move is so outrageous
just let me in (wasting time)
just let me in let's make it look right

so stay up and get down
sleep's just time spent wasting time
so get down, get down
let's make it happen all night

you're moving close, my pulse is racing
we're getting close, yeah i can taste it
i've never done it quite like this
so slow it down now, just slow it down

the looks you give are so contagious
the way we move is so outrageous
just let me in (wasting time)
just let me in, let me in
so stay up and get down
sleep's just time spent wasting time
so get down, get down
let's make it happen all night

you count them one, two three
you look so cute when you get that mad
you drain the life from me and it feels oh so good
