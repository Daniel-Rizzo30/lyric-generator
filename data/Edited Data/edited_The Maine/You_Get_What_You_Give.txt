wake up kids
we've got the dreamers disease
age  we got you down on your knees
so polite, you're busy still saying please
frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend
every night we smash their mercedes-benz
first we run,and then we laugh 'til we cry

but when the night is falling
you cannot find the light
you feel your dreams are dying
hold tight

you've got the music in you
don't let go
you've got the music in you
one dance left
this world is gonna pull through
don't give up
you've got a reason to live
can't forget
we only get what we give
i'm comin' home baby
you're tops
give it to me now
four a.m. we ran a miracle mile
we're flat broke
but hey we do it in style
the bad rich
god's flying in for your trial

but when the night is falling
you cannot find a friend (friend)
you feel your tree is breaking
just bend

you've got the music in you
don't let go
you've got the music in you
one dance left
this world is gonna pull through
don't give up
you've got a reason to live
can't forget
we only get what we give
this whole damn world, could fall apart
you'll be okay, follow your heart
you're in harms way, i'm right behind
now say you're mine

you've got the music in you
don't let go
you've got the music in you
one dance left
this world is gonna pull through
don't give up
you've got a reason to live
can't forget
we only get what we give

don't let go
i feel the music in you
(in you)
fly high, fly high
what's real, can't die
you only get what you give
you are gonna get what you give
don't give up
just don't be afraid to live
health insurance rip off lying
fda big bankers buying
fake computer crashes dining
cloning while they're multiplying
fashion shoots with beck and hanson
courtney love, and marilyn manson
you're all fakes run to your mansions
come around we'll kick your ass in

don't let go
one dance left
don't give up
can't forget
