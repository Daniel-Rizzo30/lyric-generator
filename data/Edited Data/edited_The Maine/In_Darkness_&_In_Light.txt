everything we do in this life has a consequence of some sort
whether it's going for a walk or going to war
the end result is uncertain, so we must be sure of our message
we must be sure of our desire
stay true to your word, live as if you have no regrets
and no matter the outcome, stand proud knowing your two hands
did something that will be remembered for centuries to come

we're just trying to find some color in this black and white world[x
