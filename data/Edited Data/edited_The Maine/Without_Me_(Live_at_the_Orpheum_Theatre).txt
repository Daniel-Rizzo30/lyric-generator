found you when your heart was broke
i filled your cup until it overflowed
took it so far to keep you close
i was afraid to leave you on your own

i said i'd catch you if you fall
and if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
and then i got you off your knees
put you right back on your feet
just so you could take advantage of me

tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
you know i'm the one who put you up there
name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why,  i don't know why
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why, don't know
gave love 'bout a hundred tries
just running from the demons in your mind
then i took yours and i made 'em mine
i didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

said i'd catch you if you fall
and if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
and then i got you off your knees
put you right back on your feet
just so you could take advantage of me

so tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
you know i'm the one who put you up there
name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why
yeah, i don't know why
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why
yeah, i don't know why

so tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
you know i'm the one who put you up there
name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why, i don't know why
thinking you could live without me
thinking you could live without me
baby, i'm the one who put you up there
i don't know why
yeah, i don't know why
