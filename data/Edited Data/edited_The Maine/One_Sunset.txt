as the sun takes the city
on the island of the rose
it's not london calling me
it's my heart back home

oh, she waits for me in the rain outside
as i patiently try to pass the time
oh, i had my fun in the smoke and clouds
but the day is done, now all i want is to get out 'cause it's been
days, weeks, no light in this square mile
her face, my mind, just one more twilight

one sunset left in england
so go on then, trouble
one sunset 'til i see her
in her red sundress
so i'll have a smoke and i'll fix a drink
then i'll blow a kiss to the bloody queen
oh, my love, she waits, so long overdue
one more sun to set, then i'll cross the sea to you

it's been two weeks in the rain
and it's hazy in my head
one more sunset in this place
'til i see her again
well she waits for me in the rain outside
as i patiently try to pass the time
oh, i had my fun in the smoke and clouds
but the day is done, now all i want is to get out 'cause it's been
days, weeks, no light in this square mile
her face, my mind, just one more twilight

one sunset left in england
so go on then, trouble
one sunset 'til i see her
in her red sundress
so i'll have a smoke and i'll fix a drink
then i'll blow a kiss to the bloody queen
oh, my love, she waits, so long overdue
one more sun to set, then i'll cross the sea to you
(cross the sea to you)

let it fade
let it fade away, away
let it fade
let it fade

so i'll have a smoke and i'll fix a drink
then i'll blow a kiss to the bloody queen
oh, my love, she waits, so long overdue
one more sun to set, then i'll cross the sea to you
