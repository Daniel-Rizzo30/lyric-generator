i took a trip up the west coast
lax to sfo
was searching for a temp so low
and a summer high
the sun swayed and set slow
i made waves with some friends i know
i got lost in the ebb and flow
of the drifting tide
and i

i didn't ever want to come down
from that west coast rush and summer high
and easy, peaceful sense of time
i felt so alive
now i'm alone when i'm back home
it's cold and old
but in my mind
i, i am
miles and miles away
i'm miles away

pretty pretty girls on two wheels
dolores heights and a laid-back feel
we sat and drank for a while until
the city came alive
we were smoking with strangers
we were dancing with the lights on
i was singing to "the angels"
see that's my favorite x song
i didn't ever want to come down
from that west coast rush and summer high
and easy, peaceful sense of time
i felt so alive
now i'm alone when i'm back home
it's cold and old
but in my mind
i, i am
miles and miles away

miles away
in my mind i'm miles and miles away
in my mind i'm miles away...

when the buzz ain't like it was
well then it's time for a change
just a subtle change
a tongue full of only tomorrow's
will never quench your thirst for today
so what do you say we take a trip miles away?
(just take a trip)
just take a trip miles away
(just take a trip)
just take a trip miles away
i don't ever want to come down
from this west coast rush and summer high
and easy, peaceful sense of time
i feel so alive
at the moment any place i go
is beautiful
because in my mind
i, i am
miles and miles away

miles away
in my mind i'm miles and miles away
in my mind i'm miles away...
because in my mind
i, i am
miles and miles
