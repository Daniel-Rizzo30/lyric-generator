break down, hysteric and young
uncomfortably numb
then you sent my pain into oblivion
i was on the verge of breaking down
then you came around
and not a second too late (too late, too late, too late)

well, give two fingers to the person that i used to be
you shook the noose, slipped my head loose
and now that boy is history
and you see that i knew better, yeah, i knew better
than to refuse your hand, you rescued me from myself

oh, just slip the noose
untie the rope from my wrists
i was about to let go
'til i knew you existed

break down, hysteric and young
uncomfortably numb
then you sent my pain into oblivion
i was on the verge of breaking down
then you came around
and not a second too late
well, loneliness is hell and you're alone
but i can tell you that it's everything you need
because it brought you back to me
and now you see that i knew better, yeah, i knew better
than to refuse your hand, you rescued me from myself

oh, just slip the noose
untie the rope from my wrists
i was about to let go
'til i knew you existed

break down, hysteric and young
uncomfortably numb
then you sent my pain into oblivion
i was on the verge of breaking down
then you came around
and not a second too late

(too late, too late, too late
too late, too late, it's not too late, oh no)

oh, just slip the noose
untie the rope from my wrists
so break down, hysteric and young
uncomfortably numb
then you sent my pain into oblivion
i was on the verge of breaking down
(oh, just slip the noose, untie the rope from my wrists)
i was on the verge of breaking down
(i was about to let go 'til i knew you existed)
i was on the verge of breaking down
then you came around
and not a second too late
