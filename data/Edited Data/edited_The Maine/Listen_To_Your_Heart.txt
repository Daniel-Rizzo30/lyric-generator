we're too young
this is never gonna work
that's what they say
that you're gonna get hurt
but i know something they don't
i hear your heart
beating right in time
right from the start
i knew i had to make you mine
and now i'll never let you go

don't they know that love won't lie?

don't listen to the world
they say we're never gonna make it
don't listen to your friends
they would have never let us start
don't listen to the voices in your head
listen to your heart

this promise
doesn't have to be too loud
just whisper, i could find you in a crowd
i think it's time we ran away
your father, he says i'm not good enough, and
your mother, she thinks that this is just a phase
i think that we should run away
don't listen to the world
they say we're never gonna make it
don't listen to your friends
they would have never let us start
don't listen to the voices in your head
listen to your heart

you got to listen to your heart
go on and listen to your heart
come on and listen to your heart
it'll tell the truth
it'll set you free
it'll say that you were meant for me
and this is where we're supposed to be

don't listen to the world
they say we're never gonna make it
but i know we'll make it
don't listen to your friends
they would have never let us start
and don't listen to the voices in your head
love will never ever let us fall apart
you got to listen to your heart
come on and listen to your heart
you gotta listen to your
come on and listen to your heart
listen to your heart
