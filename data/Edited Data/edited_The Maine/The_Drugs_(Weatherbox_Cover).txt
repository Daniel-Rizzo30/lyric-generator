i was born again in a foreign place
with my pupils wide and my friends on stage
it was a warmth i had not had the pleasure to face
and when the music fades the kids could care less
it's a mockery of the time we spent
so i crept into a hole where i could rest

you can paint me a junkie
it's quite alright
i've got all the drugs in the world
i've got all the drugs in the world

i was bound and gagged and held to the flames
and you expect me to try to entertain
this curtain of humans who always knew my name
so i wrote new songs, and we danced for nights
and we smoked it all 'til the bag was dry
i part the doors and creep back into the light

you can paint me a junkie
it's quite alright
i've got all the drugs in the world
i've got all the drugs in the world
you can have me anyway you want me
my body's yours
i've got all the love in the world
i've got all the love in the world
i've got all the love in the world
i've got all the love in the world
i've got all the love in the world
i've got all the love in the world
