it hit me today
wherever you are is just where you're at
not where you'll always be
so wherever you are in the world
i want you to be there
and only there
please know that life would be shit without you
i feel all sorts of good just thinking about you
i mean it when i say it
i genuinely hope you find whatever it is you're looking for
even if you have to find it alone
