you can dye your hair, buy new clothes
you can change your shoes, rearrange your nose
but it don't change the fact that you're ugly on the inside
you can search for love, find someone
who's just like you, yeah just as numb
but it won't change the fact you're still lonely on the inside

on the outside you are gorgeous
on the outside you are fair
oh you can change your face but it's a waste of time
because it don't change the fact that you're ugly on the inside

you've lost your charm, lost that glow
it's safe to say you lost control
and you just can't go back to the days before the dark side
pretend to hear, pretend you care
this hollow trend, it's in the air
these deceptions that you wanted will eat you from the inside

on the outside you are gorgeous
on the outside you are fair
oh you can change your face but it's a waste of time
because it don't change the fact that you're ugly on the inside
if i called you up it was just to say
i liked you the other way
if i called you up it was just to say
stay away, stay away

on the outside you are gorgeous
on the outside you are fair
oh you can change your face but it's a waste of time
because it don't change the fact that you're ugly on the inside

(you're ugly on the inside
