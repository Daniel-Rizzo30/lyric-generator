my, my, my
what fangs you have
once upon a time
your eyes were wide not dead
then all the energy
reversed the chemistry
your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
now all you see is red

you should have warned me
you were blood red
oh you're blood red baby
it came without warning
now i'm wounded
you're so ruthless darling
once all the energy
reversed the chemistry
your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
now all you're seeing is
blood red

what's it like
living with your disease?
walk the streets at night
looking like a well-dressed thief
once all the chemistry
destroyed the memories
your blood, it mixed with the chemicals in your head
now all you see is red
you should have warned me
you were blood red
oh you're blood red baby
it came without warning
now i'm wounded
you're so ruthless darling
once all the energy
reversed the chemistry
your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
now all you're seeing is
blood red
blood red

you should have warned me
you were blood red
oh you're blood red baby
it came without warning
now i'm wounded
you're so ruthless darling
once all the energy
reversed the chemistry
your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
now all you're seeing is
blood red
