i remember every night we spent on weekends
with good friends
we did nothing but it seems like we did so much
back then
oh back then we would kick it laughing all relaxing
and taking things for granted
we did anything for just that little rush

just don't forget this
we won't regret this
we've got one chance to get it right

we're alive and we drive to the center of it
where we know we're all fine and this just can't be it
and in the end we all know we only breathe for so long
so tonight's the night we all roll along

oh back to our first cigarette
you know we can't forget all the faces that we've met
 ()

means everything to me
take me back to the parking lots
the sleep we fought
and all the places we got caught
this place will always be part of me
yeah you're all a part of me
just don't forget this
we won't regret this
we've got one chance to get it right

we're alive and we drive to the center of it
where we know we're all fine and this just can't be it
and in the end, we all know we only breathe for so long
so tonight's the night we all roll along

i remember every day that i spent dreaming
of leaving
this place behind i would run away from thinking
adding up all the days spent wasted
chasing the girls we hated
some things, they, they never change
take me back oh the sleepless nights
the stupid fights
it never mattered who was wrong or who was right
and now you're all a part of me

we're alive and we drive to the center of it
where we know we're all fine and this just can't be it
and in the end, we all know we only breathe for so long
so tonight's the night we all roll along
