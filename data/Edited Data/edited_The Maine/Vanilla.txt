you're still plain and fickle
looks like i don't know you
and you don't know me
at all
but your lips taste is so simple
like a spoonful of vanilla flavoured ice cream
my love

i know i'm not made of lace
and lace and potpourri
but there's nobody like me

you're boring
face it
at your best you're still basic
you're everything i hate about our youth
i'm lost and hysteric
anything but generic
don't ever
don't ever
don't you dare ever call me vanilla

i'm a mixture of water and bone
not a clone or a stepping stone
see, i am a lot of things
but i can assure you i'm not what is they say i am
not lace, not potpourri
(nobody like me)

you're boring
face it
at your best you're still basic
you're everything i hate about our youth
i'm lost and hysteric
anything but generic
don't ever
don't ever
don't you dare ever call me vanilla

so what's the matter, pretty pretty?
it really is a pity, your flavour of choice
i know that this may be a risk
but, but it's the flavour boys

you're boring, so just face it
at your best oh you're still faceless
you're everything i hate about our youth
i am lost and hysteric
anything but generic
and i never, i never
i never wanna be called vanilla
no, no
don't you call me vanilla
no, no, no
