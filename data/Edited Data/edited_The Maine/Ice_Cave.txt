take me to the water
wash away my sins
bring me to the valley
to where this all begins

it begins, oh it begins
in the end, oh in the end
will you sink or swim?
will you sink or swim?

the oldest of the children
they called him pioneer
the chosen one, the owner
the one who sees it clear

it begins, yeah it begins
oh in the end, oh in the end
will you sink or swim?
will you sink or swim?

will you sink or swim?
will you sink or swim?
will you sink or swim?

take me to the water
oh-woooah
take me to the water
oh-woooah
wash away these sins
oh-woooah
take me to the water
oh-woooah
