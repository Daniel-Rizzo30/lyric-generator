i wonder what you taste like
the salt within your skin
evil rages inside
now i'm hungry for blood again
the moon invites the madness
brings out the worst in me

don't tell me this thing's loaded
please don't tell me anything at all

you put the gun in my hand
so now run
i'll stall the demons
but you really should be leaving
i never meant to hurt anyone
i really thought that we were just having fun
but you put the gun in my hand
so now run

it's cheaper to be guilty
than lie right through my teeth
but god damn it kills me
more than you'll ever think
how'd i become so ruthless?
where is the other me?
don't tell me this thing's loaded
please don't tell me anything at all

you put the gun in my hand
so now run
i'll stall the demons
but you really should be leaving
i never meant to hurt anyone
i really thought that we were just having fun
but you put the gun in my hand
so now run
you put the gun in my hand
so now run
i'll stall the demons
but you really should be leaving
i never meant to hurt anyone
i really thought that we were just having fun
but you put the gun in my hand
so now run
