i was lying on the grass
on sunday morning of last week
indulging in my self-defeat
my mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
all twisted wrong and beat
a comfortable in three feet deep
now the fuzzy stare from not being there
on a confusing morning week
impaired my tribal lunar speak
and of course you can't become if you only say
what you would have done
so i missed a million miles of fun

i know it's up for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
making sure i'm not in too deep
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping versed and on my feet
(if you steal my sunshine)

i was lying on the bench slide
in the park across the street
l-a-t-e-r that week
my sticky paws were in to making straws
out of big fat slurpee treats
an incredible eight foot heap
now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
in a staring under heat
involved an under usual feat
and i'm not only among
but i invite who i want to come
so i missed a million miles of fun
i know it's up for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
making sure i'm not in too deep
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping versed and on my feet
(if you steal my sunshine)

i know it's done for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
not as some and hard to see
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping dumb and built to beat
(if you steal my sunshine)

my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
