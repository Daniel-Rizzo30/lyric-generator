now i'm thinking about the things that i should have said
and i'm lit just like the ash of my cigarette
can't stop thinking about the nights that i still regret
and i know
that this is all in my head
all in my head
all in my head
all in my head

so welcome to my
anxiety attacking me in real time
i've never felt so freezing cold
in the middle of the summertime
summertime

now i'm thinking about the things that i should have said
and i'm lit just like the ash of my cigarette
can't stop thinking about the nights that i still regret
and i know
that this is all in my head
all in my head

it's the same afraid i've felt before
i'm afraid how far this fall will go
either way i've felt this all before
yeah, i know, i know (i know)
that this is all in my head
it's the same afraid i've felt before
i'm afraid how far this fall will go
either way i've felt this all before
yeah, i know, i know (i know)
that this is all in my head
all in my head
all in my head
all in my head
so i tell them not to worry, i'll get over it
i still say it even if i don't believe it yet
can't stop thinking about the nights that i still regret
and i know (i know, i know)
that this is all in my head

it's the same afraid i've felt before
i'm afraid how far this fall will go
either way i've felt this all before
yeah, i know, i know (i know)
that this is all in my head
it's the same afraid i've felt before
i'm afraid how far this fall will go
either way i've felt this all before
yeah, i know, i know (i know)
that this is all in my head
all in my head
all in my head
all in my head
