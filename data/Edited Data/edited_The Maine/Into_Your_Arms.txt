there was a new girl in town
she had it all figured out
(had it all figured out)
and i'll state something rash
she had the most amazing smile
i bet you didn't expect that
but she made me change my ways
(she made me change my ways)
with eyes like sunsets baby
and legs that went on for days

i'm fallin' in love
but it's fallin' apart
i need to find my way back to the start
when we were in love
oh things were better than they are
let me back into
into your arms
into your arms

she made her way to the bar
i tried to talk to her
but she seemed so far
(she seems so far)
outta my league
i had to find a way to get her next to me
i'm fallin' in love
but it's fallin' apart
i need to find my way back to the start
when we were in love
oh things were better than they are
let me back into
into your arms
into your arms

oh she's slippin' away
i always freeze when i'm thinking of words to say
all the things she does
make it seem like love
if it's just a game (just a game)
then i like the way that we play

i'm fallin' in love
but it's fallin' apart
i need to find my way back to the start
i'm fallin' in love
but it's fallin' apart
i need to find my way back to the start
when we were in love
things were better than they are
let me back into
into your arms
into your arms
into your arms
into your arms
