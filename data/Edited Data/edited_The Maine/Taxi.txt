in the backseat of the taxi
when you told me we were only
two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
and in the backseat when you asked me
"is the sadness everlasting?"
i pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"love, i think it is"

and it creeps on in
to the corners of yourself
yeah, it creeps on in
until it hurts like hell
and you know i never knew how much i was getting into
no, i never knew how much i was getting into

in the backseat of the taxi
when you told me we were only
two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
and in the backseat when you asked me
"is the sadness everlasting?"
i pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"love, i think it is"
i can't say that i can make you feel
complete or free from your worry
but believe me when i tell you
"babe, you'll never be lonely"
you'll never be lonely
you'll never be lonely
don't you understand?
you won't be alone again

and it creeps on in
to the corners of your soul
yeah, it creeps on in
to the flawless parts as well
and you know, i never knew how much i was getting into
no, i never knew just what i was getting into

and in the backseat of the taxi
when you told me we were only
two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
and in the backseat when you asked me
"is the sadness everlasting?"
i pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"love, i think it is"
i can't say that i can make you feel complete or free from your worry
but believe me when i tell you
"babe, you'll never be lonely"
you'll never be lonely
you'll never be lonely
don't you understand?
you won't be alone again
