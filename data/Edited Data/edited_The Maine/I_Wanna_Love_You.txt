convicts
music and
you know
we up front

i see you winding, grinding, up on that pole
i know you see me looking at you and you already know
i want to love you
you already know, i want to love you
you already know

money in the air as more fell
grab you by your coat-tail, take you to the motel, ho-sale
don't tell, won't tell
baby say, i don't talk, girl, unless you told on me
baby stick on me, i'm going to stick on you
and if you pick me, then baby i'll pick you
d-o-double-g i'm going to put it on you


mobbing in the club and i'm pressing
i'm sitting back in the smoker's section
bird's eye, i've got a clear view
(you can't see me, but i can see you
it's cool, we jet, the mood is set)
your lips are wet
you're rubbing your back, and touching your neck
your body's moving!

and you know my pedigree
used to move amphetamines
and i'm loving the way you shake your ass!
in those jeans
