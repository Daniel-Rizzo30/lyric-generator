another party with the same kids
another night with the same drinks
i need to find myself a new chick
i need to kiss a set of new lips

she's gotta be something new to me
a fresh face, someone new to please
so come on, come on girl, just you and me
oh come on girl, just you and me

this kind of girl makes it rough (making it rough)
holding our breath while we touch

she won't kiss and tell, but this isn't how
she got that name, it all seems like a game
how she moves so well, i won't call this hell
if i had to guess, i'd say we have a mess you could sell

and how am i supposed to think
with her hands all over me
telling me the right things
ever so distracting
she's gotta be something new to me
loose ends but no sight of strings
so come on, come on girl, just you and me
oh come on girl, just you and me

this kind of girl makes it rough (making it rough)
holding our breath while we touch

she won't kiss and tell, but this isn't how
she got that name, it all seems like a game
how she moves so well, i won't call this hell
if i had to guess, i'd say we have a mess you could sell

she's making it harder, harder to breathe
i'm getting weaker, but still pulling the strings
the lights are all off, there's no one around
we've both lost our minds, nowhere to be found
it's getting hot, i'm not saying this is hell
but i swear, this girl's a mess you could sell

she won't kiss and tell, but this isn't how
she got that name, it all seems like a game
how she moves so well, i won't call this hell
if i had to guess, i'd say we have a mess you could sell
