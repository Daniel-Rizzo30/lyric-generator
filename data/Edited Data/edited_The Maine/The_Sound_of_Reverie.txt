let's take our time
while it's still ours to take
'cause some things hardly change
but nothing ever stays the same
let's fall back in love
with the world and who we are
and do the things we talked about
but never did before

and darling
don't blink because you will
and when you open up your eyes again
you may not recognise a friend

it may be bittersweet
'cause we're no longer
seventeen, but we're still young
so dance with me in naivety
and follow endlessly
the sound of reverie

make up our minds
while they're still ours to make
the past is in the rear view
and the future holds no weight
we've got a lot
but what have we got to lose?
besides the track of time
and all the ugly shades of blue
so forget the hearts and all the flowers
and we can share these clouds that i've been walking on
and focus on the trip we're on

it may be bittersweet
'cause we're no longer
seventeen, but we're still young
so dance with me in naivety
and follow endlessly
the sound of reverie
of reverie
of reverie
(reverie)

cause it's bittersweet
(oh, baby bitter?)
and don't you blink
or you won't remember

(it's tough to be anything these days
and tell me how much of right now is ours to take?
some say the passing of time is bittersweet
but i think i love time the most when i'm with you
and it truly doesn't mean a thing)
don't blink because you will
and when you open up your eyes again
(your eyes again)
and darling don't blink because you will
and when you open up your eyes again
you may not recognize a friend

it may be bittersweet
'cause we're no longer
seventeen, but we're still young
so dance with me in naivety
and follow endlessly
in reverie

(don't blink because you will
and when you open up your eyes again)
we're still young
so dance with me in naivety
and follow endlessly
the sound of reverie
of reverie
of reverie
the sound of
(one more time
