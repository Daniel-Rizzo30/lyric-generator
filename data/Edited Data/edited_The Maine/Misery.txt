ill say this once again
you people, you are my friends
the devil, he cant come in
tonight, thats right

looking for misery, but she found me
lying naked on the floor
i was headed insane, the devil told me his name
but hes not welcome here, anymore

tell me what do you see
(what do you see?)
when youre looking at me?
(when you look at me)
this sense of responsibility is killing me inside, yeah

looking for misery, but she found me
lying naked on the floor
(stay away, sweet misery)
i was headed insane, the devil told me his name
but hes not welcome there, anymore
stay away, sweet misery
stay away, sweet misery
the pressures building with time
i made it up in my mind
ive got excuses for all these things that i tried in my life

looking for misery, but she found me
lying naked on the floor
(stay away, sweet misery)
i was headed insane, the devil told me his name
but hes not welcome there (hes not welcome) anymore
stay away, sweet misery
not welcome anymore
stay away, sweet misery
