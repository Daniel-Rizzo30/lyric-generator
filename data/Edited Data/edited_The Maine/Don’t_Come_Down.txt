here's to now
and to nothing else
in a crowd
all by yourself

to the lows and every high
the hellos and the goodbyes
in this moment, i could die with you
never felt like this before
dizzy, drunk, and beautiful
in this moment, i let go with you

when you are next to me and the music's loud
singing 'hey nineteen' somewhere in the crowd
we're up so high
they can't touch us now
we are thousands of feet from the ground
and won't come down
we won't come down

yeah, here's to all
to all this culture's rules and your pretty things
how dirty, wild, blurry, juvenile
we ain't got no time for what tomorrow brings
and the choir sings
to all the lows and every high
the hellos and the goodbyes
in this moment, i could die with you

when you are next to me and the music is loud
singing 'hey nineteen' somewhere in the crowd
we are up so high
they can't touch us now
we are thousands of feet from the ground
and won't come down
we won't come down

here's to now
and to nothin' else
in the crowd
all by yourself
to the lows and every high
the hellos and the goodbyes
in this moment, i could die with you
yeah, right here with you

and when you are next to me and the music is loud
singing 'hey nineteen' somewhere in the crowd
yeah, we're up so high
they can't touch us now
we are thousands of feet from the ground
yeah, we're never going down
to the lows and every high
the hellos and the goodbyes
in this moment, i could die with you
(and we're never going down)
never felt like this before
dizzy, drunk, and beautiful
in this moment, i let go with you
