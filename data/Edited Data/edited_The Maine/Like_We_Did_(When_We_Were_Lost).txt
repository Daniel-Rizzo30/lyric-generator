the ship got lost
the tides they tossed
and as we watched
our vessel sank
we wanted more
not sure what for
what we explore
is what we'll take
we found a beach
we lost our sleeves
we slept in trees
the fire burned
when we awoke
we found a boat
and as we float
the world it turns on
on and on, its turning on[x]
on and on
if were lost, if were lost, at least its together[x]
as we danced
to your favorite song
you made a face
like you were having much fun
so i asked
and you smiled
and you laughed
just like a child
and you said
when i'm with you
i can do no wrong
because you make me feel so young
