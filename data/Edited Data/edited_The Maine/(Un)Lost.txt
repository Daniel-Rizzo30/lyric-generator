i'm not looking for anything
in particular
but i'm far more desperate than you think
i wonder what it's like to be the universe
experiencing itself ironically

i need some space to run around
i'll always have the underground
i'll build my road despite the cost
i'm not looking to be found
no, no not at all

unaware of where i'm going
or if i'm going anywhere at all
but i know i'll take the leap
if it is worth the fall
so long as the blood keeps flowing
i'll set a sail and swim across
i'm not looking to be found
just want to feel unlost

with my eyes closed this feels like home
adrift in my own head
and all i really know is
whatever this is it doesn't get easier
so take it slow
just take it slow
between the silence and the sound
i'll never lose the underground
i'll build my road despite the cost
i'm not looking to be found
no, no not at all

unaware of where i'm going
or if i'm going anywhere at all
but i know i'll take the leap
if it is worth the fall
so long as the blood keeps flowing
i'll set a sail and swim across
i'm not looking to be found
no, not at all

the world is ours
but for a flash
and you are not allowed to be anybody else
control what you can
confront what you can't
and always remember how lucky you are to have yourself

unaware of where i'm going
or if i'm going anywhere at all
but i know i'll take the leap
if it is worth the fall
so long as the blood keeps flowing
i'll set a sail and swim across
i'm not looking to be found
just want to feel unlost
