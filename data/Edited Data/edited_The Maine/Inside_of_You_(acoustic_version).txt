i'm on a trip
i can't get off
can't get over
i want it all
i want it all inside of you
i call you up
you're getting off
i'm coming over

you're twenty-one
i see your eyes
you're barely sober
i hear your voice
youre calling out from me to you
i pour a drink
you move in quick
you're moving forward
then you said..

no, whoa-oa
i'm never gonna be inside of you
and i said
no, whoa-oa
i'm never gonna see inside of you
because i know i'm gonna fall
and you'll be waiting for it all
because i know, i know, i know
i can't get inside of you
inside of you
this fragile game
it's like a train
it's headed nowhere
it never stops
and i can't see the exit sign
we're headed north
i see the cliff
were getting closer
(look out baby)

so don't say that you just wanna run away
replay all the things that i tried to say
i'm twenty-one so
you're getting off, i'm coming over
then you said...

no, whoa-oa
i'm never gonna be inside of you
and i said
no, whoa-oa
i'm never gonna see inside of you
because i know i'm gonna fall (fall)
and you'll be waiting for it all
because i know, i know, i know
i can't get inside of you
inside of you
