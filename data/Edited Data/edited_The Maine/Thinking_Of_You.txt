went outside and saw the moon
and it made me think of you
then the rain it came and came
there you were inside my brain

i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you

driving in my car
(i heard the radio)
play that dylan song
("the times they are-a changing")
but you still haven't changed your mind
so i sat and sang along
i was singing along

i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you

'cause you're in my head
and i can't take it
i need you by my side
(i need you by my side)
so i'll take the ten and i'll drive till dawn
to show you i'm the one
went outside and saw the moon
and it made me think of you

i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you
i've been thinking of you
