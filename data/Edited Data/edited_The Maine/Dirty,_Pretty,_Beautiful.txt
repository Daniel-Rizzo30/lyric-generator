everything around me became suddenly
unreal
as if in a dream

chemically everything's telling me not to fight this
it's metaphysical
levity better be telling me that tonight's just
a reason to lose
to lose control

we've got this thing and it's untouchable
it's so dirty, pretty, beautiful
(dirty, pretty, beautiful)
this energy is not material
and it's never gonna let you down
tell me, can you feel it now?

chemically everything's telling me it's all righteous (is it alright?)
you've got to learn to roll
i believe mentally clarity's here tonight, just
learn to relax
and free your soul
i want people, not things
your silhouette is gold
keep all the finer things
i want intangible
give me your energy
give me invisible
a reason to lose
to lose control

we've got this thing and it's untouchable
it's so dirty, pretty, beautiful
(dirty, pretty, beautiful)
this energy is not material
and it's never gonna let you down
tell me, can you feel it now?
