"i lost her in "
he tells me then looks away
it's simple he loved her so
a tenderness you can't let go

he said, "son you don't forget your first true love
she won't forget you too"

i only like the sad songs
(from the rock bands no one knows)
no one gets me like the sad songs
(when i'm lost and i'm all alone)
just put the needle on the record
and if only for one second
it's enough

her father he arranged the marriage
and he gave away his daughters heart for goodness sake
what a shame, what a big mistake
a daughter's heart's not a good one to break

so i said "love it has no age
just wait; you'll find someone who will call you 'baby'"
i only like the sad songs
(from the rock bands no one knows)
no one gets me like the sad songs
(when i'm lost and i'm all alone)
just put the needle on the record
and if only for one second
it's enough

you only like the sad songs?
well here's a sad song for you, my love

i only like the sad songs
(from the rock bands no one knows)

and if only for one second
it's enough

you only like the sad songs
you only like the sad songs
you say you like the sad songs
here's a sad song for you, my love
for you, my love
