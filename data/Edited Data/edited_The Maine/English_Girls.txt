the girls are crying on the corner
'cause the boys all left
and they've had too much to drink
we're in london, mid-october
he's convinced the blonde by the bar just gave him a wink
and the words he spoke left me in disbelief

he said, "smoke whatever you've got left
it's getting late and we don't have much to lose"
well, she said, "english girls, they just like sex"
i couldn't believe when he said, "i've got news for you
american boys do too
american boys do too"

her face went red as the words left his tongue and
she rolls up a cigarette and he strikes a paper match
i can tell he's pouring honey into her ear as
us teenage kids were getting pissed on cider and black

pins her against the wall
tells her she's beautiful
she says she's going home
that's when he said
"smoke whatever you've got left
it's getting late and we don't have much to lose"
well, she said, "english girls, they just like sex"
i couldn't believe when he said, "i've got news for you
american boys do too"

and that boy, he is a drifter
tomorrow he'll be far away
and the moment before he kissed her

he pins her against the wall
tells her she's beautiful
she says she's going home
that's when he said

"smoke whatever you've got left
it's getting late and we don't have much to lose"
and then she said, "english girls, they just like sex"
i couldn't believe when he said "i've got news for you
all these american boys do too
american boys do too
all these american boys do too, yeah
