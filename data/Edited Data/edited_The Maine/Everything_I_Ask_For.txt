she takes her time with the little things
love notes reminding me (reminding me)
she wears red when she's feeling hot (so hot)
i have her, but it's all i got
she looks best without her clothes
i know it's wrong but that's the way it goes

i don't know what she sees in me (she looking at me)
but i'm happy that she's happy now that she's with me
and i'm freaking out because i'm just so lucky

oh, she makes me feel like shit (it's always something)
but i can't get over it (she thinks it's nothing)
'cause she's everything i ask for
everything i ask for
and just a little bit more
everything i ask for
everything i ask for and so much more

she loves music, but she hates my band
loves prince, she's his biggest fan
she's not big on holding hands
but that's alright 'cause i still got her
she keeps up on current affairs
prada is what she wears
i don't know what she sees in me (she looking at me)
but i'm happy that she's happy now that she's with me
and i'm freaking out because i'm just so lucky

oh, she makes me feel like shit (it's always something)
but i can't get over it (she thinks it's nothing)
'cause she's everything i ask for
everything i ask for
and just a little bit more
everything i ask for
everything i ask for and so much more

fistfights turn into sex
i wonder what comes next
she loves to always keeps me guessing (guessing)
and she (she) won't (won't) give it up
and we (we) both (both) know
it's because

oh, she makes me feel like shit (it's always something)
but i can't get over it (she thinks it's nothing)
'cause she's everything i ask for
everything i ask for
and just a little bit more
everything i ask for
everything i ask for and so much more
