with every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
for every beating chest, i will give my bleeding heart
i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you
when you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
but there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
and i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you

(feel it all over)
all the pretty faces in love and wide awake
tonight i feel so make-believe
(feel it all over)
chances worth the taking just a touch away
do you believe what you can't see?
(feel it all over)

with every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
for every beating chest, i will give my bleeding heart
i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you
when you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
but there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
and i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you

we're standin' hand in hand, losing our cursed minds
our backs against the wall
i feel it all, all over
we dance around the pain as the world breezes by
i feel it, i feel it, i feel it all over
(feel it all over)
stars that sound so charming, dramatic, it's so true
we're made up of a thousand scars
(feel it all over)
so go and cry your heart out, this is what it says to do
tomorrow's gone, tonight is ours
(feel it all over)

with every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
for every beating chest, i will give my bleeding heart
i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you
when you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
but there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
and i swear to every god, i feel everything tonight with you

we're standin' hand in hand, losing our cursed minds
our backs against the wall
i feel it all, all over
we dance around the pain as the world breezes by
i feel it, i feel it, i feel it all over
feel it, i feel it, i feel it all over

all around you now
can you feel it?
tell me, can you feel it?
all around you now
feel it, feel it, feel it
oh, can i feel your arms around me?
can you feel it?
oh, can i feel your arms around me?
i swear to every god i feel everything tonight with you
we're standin' hand in hand, losing our cursed minds
our backs against the wall
i feel it all, all over
we dance around the pain as the world breezes by
i feel it, i feel it, i feel it all over
feel it, i feel it, i feel it all over
