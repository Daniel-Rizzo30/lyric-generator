last christmas
i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance
but you still catch my eye
tell me baby
do you recognize me?
well
its been a year
it doesn't surprise me
(merry christmas)
i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying i love you
i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kissed me now
i know you'd fool me again

last christmas
i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
a crowded room
friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you
and your soul of ice
my god i thought you were
someone to rely on
me?
i guess i was a shoulder to cry on

a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a man under cover but you tore me apart
now i've found a real love you'll never fool me again

last christmas
i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
