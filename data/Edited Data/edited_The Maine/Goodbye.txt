you've been searching or something
that you never going find
look ahead to tomorrow
kiss yesterday goodbye
all the wants
there's these needs
i've been there
please believe me
now here's something you'll be singing
bye
you've been walking with regret
like there's no hope for today
no, you can't paint it silver and then call it gold but
you still paint it the same
all the wants
there's these needs
oh, i've been there baby

you got to say bye bye bye
goodbye to yesterday

and when the world
gets in your way
you know what you got to say

now honey
don't believe him
lord knows
he's been deceiving
so if you're looking for some healing
well baby
look right my way


you gotta say bye bye bye (goodbye)
bye bye bye (goodbye)
bye bye bye
goodbye to yesterday
