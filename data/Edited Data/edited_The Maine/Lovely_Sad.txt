ugly little feelings
crawl inside my head
whats the point in leaving
this california king-sized bed?
what-ifs
and the should-haves
they start to eat my brain
the shadow of my youth has
made the sun go black again
i look around and i dont see the pretty things
the evil thoughts upstairs they dont need company
this broken glass it reflects back
the person ive become

and now
here i am
i feel numb
on the fence
on the run
spill my guts
what an act
i am sad
but to me im lovely sad
imaginary numbers
control the ones we love
fooled by affectation
and something up above
if youre in love with diamonds
a simple death youre dying
a wasted life to me
here we are all liars
just hoping to get higher
than everyone we meet
huxley said we live together but were always by ourselves
if you dont like this type of weather you can move to someplace else
significance is rarely found underneath your couch

so now
here you are
feeling numb
on the fence
on the run
down and out
such a drag
were all sad
but to me were lovely sad
