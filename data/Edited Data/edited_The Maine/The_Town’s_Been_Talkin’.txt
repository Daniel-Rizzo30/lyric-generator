whoo!

baby my ears are open
and i'm watching you
that language your body's speaking
it makes me sick
and you're not so smooth
because you do it for the thrill
and i'm watching you
yeah, i'm watching you

because you're in love with love
you're not in love with him
and i can tell by the way you play it off
like you don't know what you're doing to him
we've heard all about you
we know you're every move
cause you're paper thin
and it's visible
and with or without you
he'll make it through
cause you're paper thin
and it's visible
when i get the chance
to expose the truth
i'm got to make my move
i'm got to make my move
because you're all two sides
and you're struggling
we won't let this slide
no, not this time
when i get the chance
to expose the truth
i'm got to make my move
i'm got to make my move

because you're in love with love
you're not in love with him
and i can tell by the way you play it off
like you don't know what you're doing to him
we've heard all about you
we know your every move
because you're paper thin
and it's visible
and with or without you
he'll make it through
because you're paper thin
and it's visible
we've heard all about you
we know your every move
because you're paper thin
and it's visible
we've heard all about you
we know your every move
because you're paper thin
and it's visible
and with or without you
he'll make it through
because you're paper thin
and it's visible (visible, visible
