i'm taking, taking all of my time
i'm dodging words, but she's saying the right lines
she made me, made me oh so crazy
but this time i feel like i'm doing something right

it made me sick to think about
everything you put me through and how you left without
(saying goodbye) and if it's really over now
then you can walk away and it would be the last time

this is the end
of you and me
everything i used to be
back then it meant something
but you're living a lie, you just can't hide from me

you had me hanging on your last word
and now i'm feeling a little less than trusting
you had me wishing we were something
but left me here with a whole lot of nothing now

this is the end
of you and me
everything i used to be
back then it meant something
but you're living a lie, you just can't hide from me
love is a luxury she said
i'd rather be in love than dead
but not with her, oh god not with her
she's the type of girl who makes love... hurt

i'm taking, taking all of my time
i'm dodging words, but she's saying the right lines
she made me, made me oh so crazy
but this time i feel like i'm doing something right

this is the end
of you and me
everything i used to be
back then it meant something
but you're living a lie, you just can't hide from me
this is the end
of you and me
everything i used to be
back then it meant something
but you're living a lie, you just can't hide from me
