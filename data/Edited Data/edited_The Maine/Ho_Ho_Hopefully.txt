december first i'm in a foreign state
i'm running late, i'm all alone
wishing i was home with you, baby
she's got a way of making things okay
when she's not around, when she's not around
i'm going crazy
we like to talk about the plans we make
and things we say when we're together
i hope for better weather this year
but you my dear, need to know
this year i want you alone

ho ho hopefully this holiday will make us believe that
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
and we're ho ho hoping that
we all come back and as a matter of fact i know
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
together by this christmas tree

we go together like the winter and this sweater
and she makes me feel, she makes me feel alive inside
and when i look into her eyes, i see the blue and green
like christmas lights, like christmas lights
oh, what a sight
she says i've got a way of making everything okay
she's not alone, she's not alone, and never will be
ho ho hopefully this year i'll have you alone
ho ho hopefully this holiday will make us believe that
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
and we're ho ho hoping that
we all come back and as a matter of fact i know
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
together by this christmas tree

(don't you know this year i want you alone?)
baby i want you alone

ho ho hopefully this holiday will make us believe that
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
and we're ho ho hoping that
we all come back and as a matter of fact i know
we're exactly where we're supposed to be
together by this christmas tree
