"i never wanna be a distraction"
you say as
you're unashamed and naked
i feel okay all over
void of all composure
and i know this may sound narcissistic
i like the lips you kiss with
but i want to wear your lipstick
'cause it means i got to kiss them
you say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
and i say, yeah, yeah, yeah

one, two hits
her lips and bad behavior
i'm in danger
three, four a.m
the feeling's getting stranger
i'm in danger
bad behavior

and i don't have time for your feelings
you told me
you're insecure, but don't be
stay soft, but don't be gentle
it's altogether mental
let's go to a place where we can forget
we haven't left the room yet
you eloquently stated
leaving's overrated
you say, you say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
and i say, yeah, yeah, yeah

one, two hits
her lips and bad behavior
i'm in danger
three, four a.m
the feeling's getting stranger
i'm in danger

oh, i inhale you in small doses
but adore you like the roses
you're bad for me, yeah
but you're bad for me, yeah
you medicate me with your poses
i'm a lush, i know you notice
you're bad for me, yeah
but you're bad for me, yeah
you're bad for me, yeah
ohhh, and i say, yeah, yeah, yeah

one, two hits
her lips and bad behavior
i'm in danger yeah, yeah
oh, here we go again
hope it don't lose its flavor
and i'm in danger
yeah, i'm in danger
i think i know that you're bad for me
oh, i know you're bad for me, yeah
