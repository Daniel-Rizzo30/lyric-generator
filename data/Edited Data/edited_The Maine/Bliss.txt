this is where we belong
this is where we long to be
repose, inhale
just breathe

and i say what doesn't kill you
will keep you sane
just go lift the veil
from your left brain

is this not what you're here for?
is this not why you came?
buy a ticket to a place that no one can explain
just take the ride
allow yourself to give in to this bliss

a day late
another dollar short
i had to burn the bills to keep warm
i fear the disease they carry
but those paper cuts don't scare me now
that i can see
is this not what you're here for?
is this not why you came?
buy a ticket to a place
that no one can explain
just take the ride
allow yourself to give in to this bliss

is this not what you're here for?
is this not why you came?
buy a ticket to a place
that no one can explain

is this not what you here for?
is this not why you stayed?
find your way to feeling nothing
can replace
well, just take the ride
allow yourself to give in to this
