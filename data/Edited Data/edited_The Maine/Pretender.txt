theres always a reason
to stay inside your head
but youll never make it out
so you found a reason (give me a reason)
to make believe instead
now youre somebody else

but you dont have to hide your scars
not from me tonight (at all)

show me the real you
misunderstood can feel so good
you dont have to hide yourself
pretender, pretender
show me the real you
surrender yеah, i wish you would
you dont have to hide yourself
prеtender, pretend

that you are an ocean
strong but delicate
it doesnt matter where you run
for the next  minutes
pretend that you are infinite (you are infinite)
and the hiding out is done
but you dont have to hide your scars
no not at all from me tonight (at all)

show me the real you
misunderstood can feel so good
you dont have to hide yourself
pretender, pretender
show me the real you
surrender yeah, i wish you would
you dont have to hide yourself
pretender, pretender
pretender, pretender

we all play roles as people, believe me
were lying to ourselves
dont belong, you dont belong at all
you gotta be brave to be here, believe me
i hope you find yourself
dont belong
you dont belong at all
show me the real you
misunderstood can feel so good
you dont have to hide yourself
pretender, pretender
show me the real you
surrender yeah, i wish you would
you dont have to hide yourself
