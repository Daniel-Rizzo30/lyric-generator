to begin, i'm not sorry
for myself or any part of me
i wont beg on your pardon, you see
you know i'm not a human
one part anxiety using two parts naivety
just to keep sane

i'm a bitter little pill to swallow
im a little bit of let down, my
my feet are hard to follow
my best habit's lettin' you down
am i makin' any sense? i don't know
i'm a little bit of let down, my
my feet are mine to follow
you don't get to decide

if you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habits letting you down
and if youre searching for a sure thing, nice dream
somethin' like a machine
then my best habits letting you down
to you, i don't exist
ain't what you're lookin for
good thing i don't exist for you at all anymore
so if you're waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habit's letting you down
now we're back to the matter
well, if it's average you're after
or ordinary, you'll have to move on
see, without me, i'm not myself
if i'm not me, then i am everyone else
and then who would be john?

i'm a bitter little pill to swallow
i'm a little bit of let down, my
my feet are hard to follow
my best habit's lettin' you down
am i makin' any sense? i don't know
i'm a little bit of let down, my
my feet are mine to follow
you don't get to decide

if you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habit's letting you down
and if you're searching for a sure thing, nice dream
somethin' like a machine
then my best habit's letting you down
to you, i don't exist
ain't what you're lookin' for
good thing i don't exist for you at all anymore
so if you're waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habit's letting you down
as a single tear falls to the ground
for the people that we are not now
if you're not you, you're everyone else
who are you? who are you now?
burned our teenage years down to the ground
oh, the hand on the clock's wearing out
if you're not you, you're everyone else
who are you? who are you?

if you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habit's letting you down
if you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
then my best habit's letting you down
and if you're searching for a sure thing, nice dream
somethin' like a machine
then my best habit's letting you down
to you, i don't exist
ain't what you're lookin' for
good thing i don't exist for you at all anymore
so if you're waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
cheap high, lullaby
