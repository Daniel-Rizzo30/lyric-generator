worse or better
i'm leaving
no more laughter
i mean it
you're broken
i promise
i'll miss you
i'm sorry
worse or better
i'm leaving [x]

if i run away
i'll never look back
run away
if i run away
i'll never look back [x]

you can beg, you can cry
you can say you'll try
but i can't take that chance
if i run away
i'll never look backx]

i can't fool you no
you know me
pushed me too hard
i'm shaking
you're talking
no walking
you tripped me
i'm falling
worse or better
i'm leaving





never look back
i'm leaving
