looks like we made it
look how far we've come my baby
we might've took the long way
we knew we'd get there someday

they said, "i bet they'll never make it"
but just look at us holding on
we're still together still going strong

you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
(you're still, you're still the one)
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
(you're still the one)

ain't nothing better
we beat the odds together
i'm glad we didn't listen
look at what we would be missing
they said, "i bet they'll never make it"
but just look at us holding on
we're still together still going strong

you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
(you're still, you're still the one)
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
(you're still the one)

you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
(you're still, you're still the one)
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
(you're still the one
