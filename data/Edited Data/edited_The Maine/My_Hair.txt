my hair is tired
and it's falling out
but before it all does
i think i will let it down

i'll grow it out like
it's the sixties man
because i feel young enough
and just because i can

grow your hair out
let your hair down
while you still can
because it'll fall out
you'll go bald
like an old man

put the top down
let your locks blow around
driving through town without a care
grow it to the ground
let it all down everywhere
grow out your hair
the other morning
as i rolled on out
of my bed i got tripped up
by something on the ground

my curls had grown
all the way to the floor
kinda like the way it looks
i'll grow it out some more

grow your hair out
let your hair down
while you still can
because it'll fall out
you'll go bald
like an old man

put the top down
let your locks blow around
driving through town without a care
grow it to the ground
let it all down everywhere
(let it all down, man)
nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
not my momma or a big wig millionaire
i'll let it all down anywhere
i'll let it all down everywhere

see, i don't care
if you all care
it's on my head and
it's not your hair

grow your hair out
let your hair down
while you still can
because it'll fall out
you'll go bald
like an old man

put the top down
let your locks blow around
driving through town without a care
grow it to the ground
let it all down everywhere
grow out your hair
nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
(nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair)
nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
(gotta cut loose, oh!)

nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
(let it all down)
nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
(grow out your hair
