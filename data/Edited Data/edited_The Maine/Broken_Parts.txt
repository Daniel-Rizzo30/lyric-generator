well, it isnt getting easier
we are shattered everywhere
no, it isnt getting easier now
but were not beyond repair

and we are brittle, beware
we crack, we tear
handle with care
half done entirely
we fall apart
rebuild, restart
right where we are
found wanting everything

fractured in fragments
us fragile things
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken
fractions and halves of
some greater thing
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken parts
but we're all the same broken parts
but we're all the same

you cant fall any further
any further from the floor
so gather up yourself now, love
just as you were before

and we are brittle, beware
we crack, we tear
handle with care
half done entirely
we fall apart
rebuild, restart
right where we are
found wanting everything

fractured in fragments
us fragile things
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken
fractions and halves of
some greater thing
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken parts
but we're all the same broken parts
but we're all the same broken parts

we fall apart
rebuild, restart
right where we are
found wanting everything

fractured in fragments
us fragile things
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken
fractions and halves of
some greater thing
falling to pieces
but were all the same broken parts

but we're all the same broken parts
but we're all the same broken parts
