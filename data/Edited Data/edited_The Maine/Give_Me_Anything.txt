the boys they have their eyes all over you
and you're loving every second of attention
i need to find just some way to get through
or at least some way that i can mention

i'm feeling you
you're feeling me
what exactly is holding us back?
i'm feeling you
are you feeling me?
just give me something
give me, give me, give me anything
oh it's you
and it's true
you're electric i can't get over it

you're running through my veins you feel like a freight train
i'm trying everything to keep my hands off of you
so give me something
please just give me anything
because i want you more than they do
and oh no
i think i lost myself in your deep blue eyes
and oh no
i think it's time we cut to the chase tonight
oh it's you, and it's true, you're electric, i can't get over it[x]
i'm feeling you, (you're electric)
you're feeling me, (and i can't get over it)
what exactly is holding us back?
i'm feeling you, (you're electric)
you're feeling me, (and i can't get over it)
just give me anything
