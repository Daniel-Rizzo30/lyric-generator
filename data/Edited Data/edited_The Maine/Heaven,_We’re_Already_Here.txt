blessed be the night we're breathin' in
unforgettable and so benevolent
the closest that we'll get to heaven-sent
for all us darling aliens
and we will never be this young again
so full of fire and rebellion
now shoot the night just like it's medicine
and we all will be born again, again, again, again, again

this is everything you prayed for
(pray for, pray for, pray for)
this is everything i need
please, don't anybody pray for me
(my soul isn't yours to save anymore)
life is crazy, baby, don't forget the seatbelt
adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn doors
our great unknown, the open road

blessed be the sky we're soaring in
so few of us and millions of them
daylight isn't far away, my friend
and we all will be born again, again, again, again, again
life is crazy, baby, don't forget the seatbelt
adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn doors
our great unknown, the open road

so alive, we could die
as we drive all night in the afterlife
through and through, by and by
everything i love is right here tonight
seven, heaven, oh, it's clear
heaven, we're already here
let it live, let it die
no, we can't get off, here we are tonight
through and through, by and by
as we drive all night in the afterlife
seven, heaven, oh, it's clear
heaven, we're already here

what you livin', what you livin', what you livin' for?
what you livin', what you livin', what you livin' for?
what you livin', what you livin', what you livin' for?
is what you're livin' for worth dyin', worth dyin' for?

and this is everything you prayed for
(pray for, pray for, pray for)
this is everything i need
please, don't anybody pray for me
(my soul isn't yours to save anymore)
life is crazy, baby, baby
(adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn doors
our great unknown, the open road)
adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn door
our great unknown, the open road
so alive, we could die
as we drive all night in the afterlife
through and through, by and by
everything i love is right here tonight
seven, heaven, oh, it's clear
heaven, we're already here
let it live, let it die
no, we can't get off, here we are tonight
through and through, by and by
as we drive all night in the afterlife
seven, heaven, oh, it's clear
heaven, we're already here
