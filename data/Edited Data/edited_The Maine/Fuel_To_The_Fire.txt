i got your call
now i'm here at your door
false alarm
because you're not here anymore
i had it all in my head what i'd say to you
but you set me up again like you always do

the more you treat me cruel
oh it just adds fuel to the fire (fuel to the fire)
tease me like you do but it just fuels my desire (fuel to the fire)
you say you don't want me, i think you're a liar
love or lust, it just adds fuel to the fire (fuel to the fire)
fuel to the fire (fuel to the fire)

sexy pics
you sent to me on my phone
and now i'm here
and i can't get you alone
i think i'm just beginning to understand
that you just like having the upper hand

i make you think you're the only one
but if we're not having fun
then we're done
and who won?


f-f-f-fire (fuel to the fire)
fuel to the fire
fire
