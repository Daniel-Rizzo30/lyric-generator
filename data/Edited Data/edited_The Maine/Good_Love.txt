tossing coins down the wishing well
don't fall in now, it leads straight to hell
i need you closer, need you beside me
good love will find me, good love will find me
the coffee's cold and it still works cold
so do the highs but you always end up alone
so no more lying and no more fighting
good love will find me [x]

good love will find me

tossing coins down the wishing well
don't fall in now, it leads straight to hell
i see the fire, it's almost blinding
come out and find me, come out and find me
so fuck your coins and i wish you well
(ahhh it feels good, don't it?)

good love will find me[x
