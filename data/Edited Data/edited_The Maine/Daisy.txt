i picked you up and lifted your wilted frame into the sun
i was taken back, yeah i was taken back
and by the time i caught my breath
you had blossomed into something that i did not expect
and if it takes all night
i swear i'll wait
for you
forever

sunlight, sunshine
all for you my daisy
we're getting this before you leave
all for you my daisy

you're a wreck and you know
you've got me wrapped around your finger
like a boy tangled in vines
but i've figured you out
and now we're here
we're so confused
and i wish that there was some way that i could tell you

sunlight, sunshine
all for you my daisy
we're getting this before you leave
all for you my daisy
all for, all for, all for you my daisy
all for, all for, all for you my daisy

sunlight, sunshine
all for you my daisy
we're getting this before you leave
all for you my daisy
sunlight, sunshine
all for you my daisy
we're getting this before you leave
all for you my daisy
