i got my eyes on you
you're everything that i see
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly
i can't get over you, you left your mark on me
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly

cause you're a good girl and you know it
you act so different around me
cause you're a good girl and you know it
i know exactly who you could be

just hold on, we're going home
just hold on, we're going home
it's hard to do these things alone
just hold on, we're going home
