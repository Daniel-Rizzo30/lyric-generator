the atlantic was born today, and i'll tell you how
the clouds above opened up and let it out
i was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
when the water filled every hole
and thousands upon thousands made an ocean
making islands where no island should go
oh, no

most people were overjoyed, they took to their boats
i thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
the rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
have been silenced forevermore
the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
it seems farther than ever before
oh, no

i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer

i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer

so come on, come on
so come on, come on
so come on, come on
so come on, come on
