i've been changing
you're still waiting on me
just wait for me

and i am on my own
but it's nice to see you came along
and this might sound wrong
but i can only tell you through a song
and i will take my time
cause it's the only thing that's on my side
and this can't be real
tell me, do you ever feel?

do you ever feel
do you ever feel? [x]

oh i've been changing
you're still waiting on me
(never let go, never let go
she said i'll never grow up

two years now since i met you
and i just can't forget about you
you don't know what you do to me
oh you don't know what you're doing to me
and baby i'm not lost
i'm just a little confused on what to do
and it's all on me
oh it's not you why can't you see?


oh who are you now?
(oh who are you now?
oh who are you now?
(oh who are you now?
this shit is so played out
it's so played out
so played out
