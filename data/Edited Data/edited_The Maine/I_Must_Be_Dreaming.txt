she thinks i'm crazy
judging by the faces that she's making
and i think she's pretty
but pretty's just part of the things she does that amaze me
and she calls me sweetheart
i love it when she wakes me when it's still dark
and she watches the sun
but she's the only one i have my eyes on

tell me that you love me
and it'll be alright
are you thinking of me?
just come with me tonight
you know i need you
just like you need me
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming

she moves in closer
whispering to me, "i thought i told ya"
and oh she's playing games now
and i figured it out now that we're
now that we're closer
two kids, one love
who cares if we make it up
her voice is sweet sound
our clothes lay on the ground
she moves in closer
whispers, "i thought i told ya"
tell me that you love me
and it'll be alright
are you thinking of me?
just come with me tonight
you know i need you
just like you need me
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming

remember the day when we started this
and she made the shape of my heart with her hands
we try to make some sense of it
but she called me on the phone and said

tell me that you love me
and it'll be alright
are you thinking of me?
just come with me tonight
you know i need you
just like you need me
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming
go one and tell 'em that you love me
and it'll be alright (i must be dreaming)
are you thinking of me
just come with me tonight (i must be dreaming)
she moves in closer
can't stop, won't stop
i must be dreaming
