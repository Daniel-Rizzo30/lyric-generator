i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there

and i said
when i'm with you well it's just like it's the first time
never thought that you would turn into my best life
before the blur, well, there you were under the lights
and i said, "when i'm with you well it's just like it's the first time"

i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there
i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there

and i said, "when i'm with you well it's just like it's the first time"
april th never meant as much as that night
before the blur, well, there you were under the lights
i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there
i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there

even when my heart stops beating
even when my eyes go blind
all i need is your heartbeat beating
next to mine, next to mine
next to mine

i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there
i see you when i close my eyes
i see you like i did that night
now underneath the hi-lo lights
i see you there, i see you there
and i said, "when i'm with you well it's just like it's the first time
