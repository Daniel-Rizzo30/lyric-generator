thoughts fall company and dreams as friends
i'm only half here
and other half pretends
that i'm just
i'm just a bad haircut
some fashion from last week
no one really knows me at all

but sometimes i like
living in my own world
disconnected and so naive
perfectly out of key

i'm not allowed to be anyone else
but me so i try
to take apart my head from time to time
and i'm not resolute so when i
need help well i would ask you
and i would try to be polite

and sometimes i like
living in my own world
disconnected and so naive
i'm perfectly out of key
and sometimes i like
living in my own world
disconnected and so naive
but the truth is i
i hate the truth

and i would rather live and die in fantasy
