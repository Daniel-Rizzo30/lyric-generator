when you left she was a wreck
cause she said you left a mess
(but you said that you'd be back home
didn't wanna see her all alone
and you bet, she took your word
cause she said you'll never learn
(all the things that you put her through
don't know why she's coming back to you

oh she says she's alone
but she knows she's in love

mr. winter, did you miss her?
for the three months you were gone
had her waiting all night long

mr. winter, don't forget her
she'll be waiting all alone
please just say you'll come back

and it's cold, but it keeps you warm
cause this love, still burns for you
and you don't know what's in store
but you both know what is true
oh she says she's alone
but she knows she's in love

mr. winter, did you miss her?
for the three months you were gone
had her waiting all night long

mr. winter, don't forget her
she'll be waiting all alone
please just say you'll come back

mr. winter, did you miss her?
for the three months you were gone
had her waiting all night long

mr. winter, don't forget her
she'll be waiting all alone
please just say you'll come back

but you said that you'd be back home (whoa oh
didn't want to see her all alone (whoa oh
all the things that you put her though (whoa oh oh
don't know why she's coming back to you
