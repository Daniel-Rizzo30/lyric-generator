before i go
please know i'm trying
trying to be a better man
before i leave
please don't get angry
just dry your eyes and take my hand

i'll make this right
oh, i will try
jenny don't you cry
close your eyes
everything is going to  be alright
you're so young and still so free
jenny take my hand
understand
i will try to be a better man
without you there is no me
jenny

there is a boy inside me running
from a man i've yet to meet
i see his face it only scares me
i hope things change eventually
