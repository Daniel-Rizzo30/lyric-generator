someday we gon' set it off
someday we gon' get this off
baby, don't you bet it all
on a pack of fentanyl
you might think they wrote you off
they gon' have to rope me off
someday the drama'll be gone
and they'll play this song on and on
sometimes i take all the shine
talk like i drank all the wine
years ahead but way behind
i'm on one, two, three, four, five
no half-truths, just naked minds
caught between space and time
this not what they had in mind
but maybe someday
