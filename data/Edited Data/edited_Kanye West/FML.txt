i been waiting for a minute
for my lady
so i can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
i been livin' without limits
as far as my business
i'm the only one that's in control
i been feeling all i've given
for my children
i will die for those i love
god, i'm willing
to make this my mission
give up the women
before i lose half of what i own
i been thinking
'bout my vision
pour out my feelings
revealing the layers to my soul
my soul
the layers to my soul
revealing the layers to my soul
see, before i let you go
one last thing i need to let you know
you ain't never seen nothing crazier than
this nigga when he off his lexapro
remember that last time in mexico?
remember that last time, the episode?
asking me why the hell i text in code?
four times just to say, "don't text me, ho"
told you four times, "don't test me, ho"
and we finna lose all self-control
but you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
especially when we in the giuseppe store
but i'ma have the last laugh in the end
'cause i'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho"
yeah, i'ma have to laugh in the end
'cause i'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho"

they don't wanna see me love you
see through the veil
they don't wanna see me love you
and forget all your cares
they don't wanna see me love you
throw them
