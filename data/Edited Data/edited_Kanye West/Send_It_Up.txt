this the cray-ist shit in the club
since "in da club"
it's so packed i might ride around
on my bodyguard's back like prince in the club
she say "can you get my friends in the club?"
i say "can you get my benz in the club?"
if not, treat your friends like my benz
park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
when i go raw, i like to leave it in
when i wake up, i like to go again
when i go to work, she gotta call it in
she can't go to work, same clothes again
and her heart colder than the souls of men
louboutin on the toes again
tight dress dancin' close to him
yeezus just rose again
