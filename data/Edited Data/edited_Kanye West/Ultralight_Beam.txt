i'm tryna keep my faith
we on an ultralight beam
we on an ultralight beam
this is a god dream
this is a god dream
this is everything
this is everything

deliver us serenity
deliver us peace
deliver us loving
we know we need it
you know we need it
you know we need it
that's why we need you now, oh
pray for paris
pray for the parents
this is a god dream
this is a god dream
this is a god dream
we on an ultralight beam
we on an ultralight beam
this is a god dream
this is a god dream
this is everything
everything (thing, thing, thing)


we on an ultralight beam
we on an ultralight beam
this is a god dream
this is a god dream
this is everything
