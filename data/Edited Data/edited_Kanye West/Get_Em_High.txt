n-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
get 'em high
all the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man

my flow is in the pocket like wallets, i got the bounce like hydraulics
i can't call it, i got the swerve like alcoholics
my freshman year i was going through hella problems
'til i built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
my teacher said i was a loser, i told her, "why don't you kill me?"
i give a fuck if you fail me, i'm gonna follow
my heart, and if you follow the charts
or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
i'm so chi that you thought i was bashful
but this bastard's flow will bash your skull
and i will cut your girl like pastor tro'
and i don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
and i won't give you that money that you askin' for
why you think me and dame cool? we assholes
that's why we hear your music and fast forward
'cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'
n-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
get 'em high
all the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
get 'em high
now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands
keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
keep 'em high (now, now, now, now, now, you've got mail)
