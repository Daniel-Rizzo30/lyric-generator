yo, gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
can they, hop?



i drink a boost for breakfast, an ensure for dessert
somebody ordered pancakes, i just sip the sizzurp
that right there could drive a sane man berserk
not to worry, mr. h-to-the-izzo's back to wizzerk
how do you console my mom or give her light support
tellin' her her son's on life support?
and just imagine how my girl feel
on the plane scared as hell that her guy look like emmett till
she was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
she a delta, so she'd been throwin' that dynasty sign
no use in me tryna be lyin', i been tryna be signed
tryin' to be a millionaire, how i used two lifelines
in the same hospital where biggie smalls died
the doctor said i had blood clots, but i ain't jamaican, man
story on mtv and i ain't tryna make a band
i swear, this right here, history in the makin', man


what if somebody from the chi' that was ill got a deal
on the hottest rap label around?
but he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
it was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
and he explained the story 'bout how blacks came from glory
and what we need to do in the game
good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
if you could feel how my face felt
you would know how mase felt (mason betha!)
thank god i ain't too cool for the safe belt
i swear to god, driver two wanna sue
i got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
my dawgs couldn't tell if i
i looked like tom cruise in vanilla sky, it was televised
there's been an accident like geico
they thought i was burnt up like pepsi did michael
i must got a angel, cause look how death missed his ass
unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me mr. glass?
look back on my life like the ghost of christmas past
toys "r" us where i used to spend that christmas cash
and i still won't grow up, i'm a grown-ass kid
swear i should be locked up for stupid shit that i did
but i'm a champion, so i turned tragedy to triumph
make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
