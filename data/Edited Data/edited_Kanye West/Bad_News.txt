didn't you know i was waiting on you?
waiting on a dream that'll never come true
didn't you know i was waiting on you?
my face turned to stone when i heard the news
when you decide to break the rules?
'cause i just heard some real bad news

people'll talk like it's old news
i played it off and act like i already knew
let me ask you how long have you known dude
you played it off and act like he's brand new
when you decide to break the rules?
'cause i just heard some real bad news


oh, you just gon' keep another, no, you won't
oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
while i'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
my face turned to stone when i heard the news
what's on the news?
