when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i've found, one thing i found
oh no, you'll never let me down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i've found, one thing i found
oh no, you'll never let me down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up

i get down for my grandfather who took my mama
made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
at the tender age of , she was arrested for the sit-ins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
but we can make it to jacob's and to the dealership
that's why i hear new music and i just don't be feelin' it
racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
but i know they don't want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sam's club
i done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
swear i've been baptized 'least three or four times
but in the land where niggas praise yukons and getting paid
it's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
so i promised to mr. rainey i'm gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side
when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i've found, one thing i found
oh no, you'll never let me down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
get up, i get down, get up, i get down
when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i found, one thing i found
oh no, you'll never let me down
get up, i get, get up, i get
get up, i get, get up, i get
get up, i get, get up, i get down
who else you know been hot this long?
(oh yeah, we ain't finished)
started from nothing but he got this strong
(the roc is in the building)
built the roc from a pebble, peddled rock before i met you
pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (wooooo)
let you tell it, man, i'm falling
well, somebody must have caught him
'cause every fourth quarter, i like to mike jordan them
number one albums, what i got? like four of them
more of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
clear the way, i'm here to stay
y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
this is jay, dissing jay will get you maced
when i start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
six hail marys, 'please father forgive us'
young the archbishop, the pope john paul of y'all niggas
the way y'all all follow jigga
hov's a living legend and i'll tell you why
everybody wanna be hov and hov's still alive
