running naked down the lobby
and you was screamin' that you love me
before the limelight tore ya
before the limelight stole ya
remember we were so young
when i would hold you
before the blood on the leaves
i know there ain't wrong with me
something strange is happenin'

you could've been somebody
we could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
or was it on the first party
when we tried our first molly
and came out of our body
and came out of our body
before they call lawyers
before you tried to destroy us
