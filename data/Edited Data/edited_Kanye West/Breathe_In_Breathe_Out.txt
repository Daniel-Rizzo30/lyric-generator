golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
i gotta 'pologize to mos and kweli (kweli)
but is it cool to rap about gold
if i told the world i copped it from ghana and mali? (mali!)
first nigga with a benz and a backpack
ice chain, carti lens, and a knapsack
always said if i rapped, i'd say somethin' significant
but now, i'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
and it's still about the benjamins
big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
strippers named "cinnamon," more chips than pentium
"what you gon' buy next?" whatever new trend it is
i'm tryna spend my stacks, and i'm so broke
i look back, like, "damn, was i on crack?"
i mean, twelve platinum chainswas i on that?
what the hell was wrong with me, dog?
sing along with me, y'all
now, even though i went to college and dropped out of school quick
i always had a ph.d: a pretty huge dick
ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
and giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
well, i'm in the club for a limited time
act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
later on, i might charge for m√©nage
heard her man was the boss of the floss
but she still want to toss me the drawers
and it ain't gon' cost me because
she my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
and i'm still acting calm than a muh'
she asked, "can you drive me in the hundreds where my altima was?"
while we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
baby, i fully understand; let me help you with a plan
while he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
give me some headthat'll really piss him off

i blow past low-class niggas with no cash
in a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
so when i go fast, po-po just laugh
right until i run out of gas or 'til i go crash
whatever comes first, i'm prepared for the worst
whatever comes second, i'll be there with my weapon
pulling up in the lexuses, one on both hand
so i guess them gs'ses was ambidextrous
could've sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
"k, i need a free hand-mammogram
i got weed, drink, and a handicam
all of which is legal in amsterdam"
so, say my name like candyman
and i'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
but if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
you can't take that all at one timeyou gotta breathe!
yeah-ugh, ugh-ugh, ugh-ugh
and you say, "chi-city" (chi-city)
y-yeah, and you say, "chi-city"
y-yeah, and you say, "chi-city" (chi-city)
uh-huh (uh-huh), and you say, "chi-city" (chi-city)
