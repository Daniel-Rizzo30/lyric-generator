why are you so paranoid? (aha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
don't be so paranoid, don't be so

baby, don't worry 'bout it
hey there, don't even think about it
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

tell me right now
you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
a little time out might do you good
might do us good 'fore we be done for good
'cause i could make it good, i could make it hood
i could make you come, i could make you go
i could make you high, i can make you fly
make you touch the sky, hey, maybe so
all of the time
you be up in mine checkin' through my cell phone, baby, no
you wanna kill the vibe on another night
here's another fight, oh, here we go (oh, here we go)
baby, don't worry about it
lady, we'll go out to the floor
anyway, they don't know you (they don't know) like i do
they'll never know you (never know)
anyway, they don't know you (never know) like i do
they'll never know you

all of the time
you wanna complain about the nights alone
so now you're here with me, show some gratitude
leave the attitude way back at home
yeah, you see 'em look
baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold
yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
don't worry about what we can't control
all the talk in the world lost in the world
'til you finally let that thing go
you wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
but sorry, we're closed

baby, don't worry about it
baby, we'll go out to the floor
anyway (hey) they don't know you (to the floor) like i do (hey)
they'll never know you (never know)
anyway, they don't know you (they don't know) like i do
they'll never know you
baby, don't worry about it
lady, don't even think about it
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
you worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
