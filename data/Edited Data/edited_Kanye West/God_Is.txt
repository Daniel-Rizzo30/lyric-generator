god is
my light in darkness, oh
god, god is
he, he is my all and all (andi'llnever turn back)
godis

everything that hath breath praise thelord
worship christ with the best of your portions
i know i won't forget all he's done
he's the strength in this race that i run
every time i look up, i see god's faithfulness
and it shows just how much he is miraculous
i can't keep it to myself, i can't sit here and be still
everybody, i will tell 'til the whole world is healed
king of kings, lord of lords, all the things he has in store
from the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
you won't ever be the same when you call on jesus' name
listen to the words i'm sayin', jesus saved me, now i'm sane
and i know, i know god is the force that picked me up
i know christ is the fountain that filled my cup
i know god is alive, yeah
he has opened up my vision
giving me a revelation
this ain't 'bout a dead religion
jesus brought a revolution
all the captives are forgiven
time to break down all the prisons
every man, every woman
there is freedom from addiction
jesus, you have my soul
sunday service on a roll
all my idols, let 'em go
all the demons, let 'em know
this a mission, not a show
this is my eternal soul
this my kids, this the crib
this my wife, this my life
this my god-given right
thank you, jesus, won the fight
