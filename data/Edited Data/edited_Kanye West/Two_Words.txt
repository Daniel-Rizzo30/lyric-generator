we in the streets, playa, get your mail
it's only two places you end up: either dead or in jail
still nowhere to go
still nowhere to go
now throw your hands uphustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
everybodyfuck that!
still nowhere to go
still nowhere to go

now throw your hands up (throw your hands up high)
hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
everybodyfuck that
still nowhere to go
still nowhere to go
and keep your hands up ('til they reach the sky)
hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
everybodyfuck that
still nowhere to go
still nowhere to go

two words: chi-town, southside, worldwide
'cause i rep that 'til i fuckin' die
one neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
one wall, twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
i am limelight, blueprint, five mics
go-getters rhyme like should've been signed twice
most imitated, grammy nominated
hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
barbershop player-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
two words: chi-town raised me, crazy
so i live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
screaming, "jesus, save me"
you know how the game be, i can't let 'em change me
'cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
look, godit's the same me
and i basically know now, we get racially profiled
'cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
plus, i got a whole city to hold down
from the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now
now throw your hands up (throw your hands up high)
hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
everybodyfuck that
still nowhere to go
still nowhere to go
