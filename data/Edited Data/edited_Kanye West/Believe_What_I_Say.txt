you need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
you ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
just one time for the record, just one time for the record
don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow

man, it's too early
what the hell you doin' wakin' me up at :?
why the hell are you worried?
play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
i don't know want my mind alerting
people sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
how 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
hold it all inside, that could make you die early
go on and get your best attorney
something's there, feel it when i heard it
just release the spirit, let it flow though
how these **** leaving now with one leg like flo-jo?
nail me to the cross with long nails, like coko
free throat coat for the throat goats
even if i gotta do it solo, even if i gotta do it with no promo
i ain't got my point across
'til we finally get across and pass the point
so there's a couple things that i gotta quote
don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
i ain't never question what you was askin' for
i gave you every single thing you was askin' for
i don't understand how anybody could ask for more
got a list of even more, i just laugh it off
i be goin' through things i had to wrote
celebrity drama that only brad'll know
too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
things i cried about, i found laughable
lil' baby jesus, ain't laughing, no
don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
the big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow in love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow

don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light (right on)
one last sparkle to follow
