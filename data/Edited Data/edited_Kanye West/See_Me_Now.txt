'cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
i got style, ask june if she heard of me
i killed the fur last paris, raised the murder rate
first of all, we all know the beats is
like a mix between fergie and jesus
imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
every one of his majestys swim parties is pageantries
cannonball off the divin' board when i am bored
all my homies gds, but i am lord
rap god, greek mythology
and this life too crazy to think logically
heres somethin' that you could use as an analogy
my life is like a childs illusions become reality
