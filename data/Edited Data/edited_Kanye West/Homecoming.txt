yeah
and you say chi city!
chi city! chi city!
i'm comin' home again
do you think about me now and then? (yeah)
do you think about me now and then?
'cause i'm comin' home again (ow!)
-min' home again

i met this girl when i was three years old
and what i loved most, she had so much soul
she said, "excuse me, little homie, i know you don't know me
but my name is windy and i like to blow trees."
and from that point, i never blow her off
niggas come from out of town, i like to show her off
they like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
and make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
and when i grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
i told her in my heart is where she'll always be
she never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
she said, "it felt like they walked and drove on me."
knew i was gang affiliated, got on tv and told on me
i guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
she said, "'ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"

but if you really cared for her
then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her
but when i talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
she said, "you left your kids, and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you," and i just got through
talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
i guess that's why i'm here and i can't come back home
and guess when i heard that? when i was back home
every interview, i'm representin' you, makin' you proud
reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
if you don't know by now, i'm talkin' 'bout chi-town
