take the top off, let the sun come in (the lord still shines on you)
whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (again)
oh, i got dirt on my name, i got white on my beard
i had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
let me make this clear, so all y'all see
i don't take advice from people less successful than me
hah? ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
and we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
had to tell the dogs, "turn the snubs off"
plus they already mad that the cubs lost
(believe it or not) these two wrongs'll right you
(believe it or not) i was too grown in high school
(believe it or not) the true soul of ice cube
too close to snipe you, truth told, i like you
too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
calm down, you light skin
