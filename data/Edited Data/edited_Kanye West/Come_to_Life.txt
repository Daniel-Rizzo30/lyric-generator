my soul cries out hallelujah and i thank god for saving me
i thank god for...

here go all your problems again (i thank god)
three, two, one, you're pinned (i thank god)
uncle now he back in the pen' (hallelujah)
auntie shut down again
did she finally come to life? (thank you, jesus)
ever wish you had another life?
ever wish you had another life?
ever wish you had another life?

don't you wish the night would go numb?
i've been feelin' low for so long
i ain't had a high in so long
i been in the dark for so long
night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
gotta make my mark 'fore i'm gone
i don't wanna die alone
i don't wanna die alone
i get mad when she gone
mad when she home
sad when she gone
mad when she home
sad when she gone (loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
floatin' on a silver lining (in the name of jesus)
yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
and my god won't deny me, tell the devil, "get behind me"
and all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
you know exactly where to find me


sadness settin' in again
three, two, one, you're pinned
uncle right back in the pen'
tell me how auntie been
took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
should've wrote 'em down in pen
and maybe they'll come to life
and maybe they'll come to life
sadness settin' in again
three, two, one, you're pinned
uncle right back to the pen'
tell me how auntie been
thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
probably should've wrote 'em in pen
and maybe they'll come to life
they could finally come to life
they could finally come to life
you know where to find me, they cannot define me
so they crucify me, how so fazed when i leave?
come and purify me, come and sanctify me
you the air that i breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
brought a gift to northie, all she want was nikes
this is not about me, god is still alive, so i'm free
floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
so when i'm free, i'm free
