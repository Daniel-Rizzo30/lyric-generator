mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, i was out for self
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, i was up for sale, but i couldn't tell
god made it rain, the devil made it hail
dropped out of school, but i'm that one at yale
made the best tracks and still went off the rail
had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
this the new ten, ten, ten, i'm goin' in, in, in
here i go on a new trip, here i go actin' too lit
here i go actin' too rich, here i go with a new chick
and i know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
it's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
architectural digest, but i needed home improvement
sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
heated by the rumors, read into it too much
fiendin' for some true love, ask kim, "what do you love?"
hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
everybody so judgemental
everybody hurts, but i don't judge rentals
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple
