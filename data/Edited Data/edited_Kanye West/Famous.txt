man, i can understand how it might be
kinda hard to love a girl like me
i don't blame you much for wanting to be free
i just wanted you to know
woo, woo
swizz told me let the beat rock (oh)
oh

for all my southside niggas that know me best
i feel like me and taylor might still have sex
why? i made that bitch famous (goddamn)
i made that bitch famous
for all the girls that got dick from kanye west
if you see 'em in the streets give 'em kanye's best
why? they mad they ain't famous (goddamn)
they mad they still nameless (talk that talk, man)
her man in the store tryna try his best
but he just can't seem to get kanye fresh
but we still hood famous (goddamn)
yeah, we still hood famous

i be puerto rican day parade floatin'
that benz marina del rey coastin'
she in school to be a real estate agent
last month i helped her with the car payment
young and we alive, whoo!
we never gonna die, whoo!
i just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
put one up in the sky
the sun is in my eyes, whoo!
woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
no matter how hard they try, whoo!
we never gonna die
