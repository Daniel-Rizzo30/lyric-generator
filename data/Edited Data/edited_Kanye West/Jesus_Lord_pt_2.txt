tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
now, we've been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
we done seen a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)

sittin by myself, i'm just thinkin'
about all ive been through, i wish i was dreaming
man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (jesus lord)
i watched so many people leave, i see 'em change by the season
that's mama's sеasonin'
god got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin in
i know i madе a promise that id never let the reaper in (jesus)
but lately, i've been losing all my deepest friends (lord)
and lately, ive been swimmin' on the deepest end
it's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it aint no love there
you've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (jesus)
suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (lord)
and while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
and everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (jesus)
did he tell you that you good and just stay focused? (lord)
mama, you was the life of the party
i swear you brought life to the party
when you lost your life, it took the life out the party (jesus)
that woman rode with me like a harley (lord)
visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' barney (jesus)
you want dreams to come true? but i had nightmares (lord)
'cause if that come to life, then i might not be right here
been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
but i'm just reaching for the stars like buzz lightyear (jesus)
and now i'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (lord)
i deaded those night tears when the night clears
and if i talk to christ, could i bring my mother back to life?
and if i die tonight, will i see her in the afterlife? (jesus)
but back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (lord)
and better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
and mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (jesus)
now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (lord)
and her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
that's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (jesus)
but we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (lord)
baby shower time, father didn't show up
and she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
the water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (jesus)
a year done went by, her daughter just turned one (lord)
and she's still dependent on her mom
big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
he want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (jesus)
and her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (lord)
but is it real love? do the scars really heal up?
from all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (jesus)
a week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (lord)
left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
he seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
to see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (jesus)
he even let him get they last meal
he done with the streets after this, this his last kill (lord)
he gotta show him that it's that real
he ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (jesus)
"you took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (lord)
"tell me one reason i shouldn't send you up to christ"
he said, "go 'head, take my life, i've seen everything but christ"
then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (jesus lord)
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)

tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)



tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
and we done been a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
we done seen a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)
been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs (jesus lord)

what up, ye? this larry hoover jr
first and foremost, i wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the oval office
you might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
and with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
you know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
we have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
my father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (tell me if you know someone that needs)
because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
after twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
and will not, once released, call any shots for the gangster disciples
if my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
man, he would be dead to me
i didn't sign up for that
i didn't stay on this journey this long for that
all my life, man, i've been waitin' for my father to come home
they told me when i graduate eighth grade, he would be home
then they told me when i graduate from high school, he would be home
i went away to morris brown, i graduated, and he still ain't home
now i'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
he still not home
now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
and they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, larry hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
free my father (jesus), mr. larry hoover sr. (lord
