life change when you famous
i remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
went through stages just to hop on new stages
open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
and i cannot sell my soul (soul)
and i cannot sell my soul (soul)
and i cannot sell my soul (yeah, soul)
and i cannot sell my soul (jesus saved my soul)
and i cannot sell my soul

i've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
and i'm just a product of whatever i was raised in
this money sanctified, so i gotta say it again
they said i was mad at the grammys
but i'm lookin' at my grammy right now
pulled up on ye, and i said, "they don't understand me"
i just want my dawg to pipe down
'cause when you really came from the trenches
you was raised in the trenches (mm)
you feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (mm)
i hope god can forgive me for the days that i was sinnin' (mhm)

the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
(man, all these lyin' ****)
i said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
made it through the trials and tribulations, huh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
uh, uh, well, well, here goes
well, here goes, but here goes
i was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
that would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
every color girbauds, every cutlass is cold
every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
out of all of the moes, out of all of the folks
after all of the jokes, i'm the one that was chose
all of my friends love to gangbang
how we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
when we both had pelles on
and we was scammin' for the prom before chief keef was "bang, bang"
always had mob ties
stood on my six points, how could i not rise?
love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but i'm not five
this southside, and we outside
this southside, and we outside
this southside, and we outside
this southside, and we outside
this southside, and we outside
and for all the guys that went to the white house and said, "free the old man"
every day i put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
personal worth is not what a person is worth
i can give a dollar to every person on earth
man, it's gotta be god's plan
man, i swear these boys keep playin'
we gon' have to square up then
we gon' have to send it up then
we gon' have to send it up then
we gon' have to send it up then, uh
we gon' have to send it up then
we gon' have to send it up then
my favorite place to send it
it ain't how it used to be
this the new me, so get used to me
it ain't how it used to be
this the new me, so get used to me
lookin' in the mirror, it's the truth of me
lookin' at my kids, it's the proof of me
devil get behind me, i'm loose, i'm free
father, holy spirit, let loose on me
father, i'm yours exclusively
devil get behind me, i'm loose, i'm free
father, holy spirit, let loose on me
father, i'm yours exclusively
devil get behind me, i'm loose, i'm free
devil get behind me, i'm loose, i'm free
