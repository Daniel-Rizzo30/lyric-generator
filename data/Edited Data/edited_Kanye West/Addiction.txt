she's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
she's coming over, so i guess, that means, i'm her drugs
(you make me smile)
just let me peek now, i mean damn, i'm so curious
she's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
time's of the essence, i need, you to be spontaneous
roll up the doja, henny and co-co-coca-cola
(you make me smile with my heart, ohh)
then i'm co-coming over cause it's ne-never over

i see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
we get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
so i pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
then i'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (you make me smile)
there's no turning back now, i mean i don't mean to impose
not now but right now, i need you to undress, and then pose
i'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
roll up the doja, henny and co-co-coca cola
(you make me smile with my heart)
and i keep co-coming over cause it's ne-never over
