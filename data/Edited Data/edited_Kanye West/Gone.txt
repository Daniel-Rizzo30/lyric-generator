wished i had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
but it's too late
it's too late
he's gone

you sweat her, and i ain't talkin 'bout a coogi
you a big l, and i ain't talkin 'bout cool j
see me at the airport, at least twenty louis
treat me like the prince and this my sweet brother numpsay
(brother numpsay!) groupies say i'm too choosy
take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
say she want diamonds, i took her to ruby tuesdays
if we up in fridays, i still have it my way, gone!

gone
we striving home
gone
i ride on chrome

y'all don't want no prob' from me
what you rappers could get is a job from me
maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
i'll show you how i cook up summer in the winter
aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
caught something on the usher tour, he had to let it burn
plus, he already got three chil'r'n
arguin' over babysitters like, "bitch, it's your turn"
"damn, ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
even your superficial raps is super-official"
r-r-r-roc pastelle with gucci on
with tvs in the ride, throw a movie on
said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with doobie long
'cause i dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone


uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh

i'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
so the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
and that make me wanna get my advance out
and move to oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
yeah, i romance the thought of leaving it all behind
kanye step away from the lime
light like when i was on the grind
in the ---
before model chicks was bending over
or dealerships asked me "benz or rover?"
man, if i could just get one beat on hova
we could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
what the summer of the chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
my dog worked at taco bell, hooked us up plural
fired a week later, the manager count the churros
sometimes i can't believe it when i look up in the mirro'
how we out in europe, spending euros
they claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
i know i got it, i don't know what y'all on
i'ma open up a store for aspiring mcs
won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
but if they ever flip sides like anakin
you'll sell everything including the mannequin
they got a new bitch, now you jennifer aniston
hold on i'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
shorties at the door 'cause they need more
inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
they said, "sorry, mr. west is gone
