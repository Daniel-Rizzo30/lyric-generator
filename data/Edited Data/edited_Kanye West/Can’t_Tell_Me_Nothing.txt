la, la, la la (yeah)
wait 'til i get my money right

i had a dream i could buy my way to heaven
when i awoke, i spent that on a necklace
i told god i'd be back in a second
man, it's so hard not to act reckless
to whom much is given, much is tested
get arrested, guess until he get the message
i feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
and what i do? act more stupidly
bought more jewelry, more louis v
my mama couldn't get through to me
the drama, people suing me
i'm on tv talking like it's just you and me
i'm just saying how i feel, man
i ain't one of the cosbys, i ain't go to hillman
i guess the money should've changed him
i guess i should've forgot where i came from

la, la, la la (ayy!)
wait 'til i get my money right
la, la, la la (yeah!)
then you can't tell me nothing, right?
excuse me, was you saying something?
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (yeah! haha!)
you can't tell me nothing (yeah! yeah!)
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (yeah!)
let up the suicide doors
this is my life, homie, you decide yours
i know that jesus died for us
but i couldn't tell ya who decide wars
so i parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
old folks talking 'bout, "back in my day"
but homie, this is my day
class started two hours ago, oh, am i late?
no, i already graduated
and you can live through anything if magic made it
they say i talk with so much emphasis
ooh, they so sensitive
don't ever fix your lips like collagen
and say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
let me know if it's a problem then
aight, man, holla, then

la, la, la la
wait 'til i get my money right
la, la, la la (yeah!)
then you can't tell me nothing, right?
excuse me, was you saying something?
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
you can't tell me nothing
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
let that man get past
he don't even stop to get gas
if he can move through the rumors
he can drive off of fumes 'cause
how he move in a room full of no's?
how he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
so when he buried in a tomb full of gold
treasure, what's your pleasure?
life is auhdepending how you dress her
so if the devil wear prada, adam eve wear nada
i'm in between, but way more fresher
with way less effort
'cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
your homies looking like, "why, god?"
when they reminisce over you, my god

la, la, la la
wait 'til i get my money right
la, la, la la
then you can't tell me nothing, right?
excuse me, was you saying something?
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
you can't tell me nothing
uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
la, la, la la
wait 'til i get my money right
la, la, la la
then you can't tell me nothing, right?
