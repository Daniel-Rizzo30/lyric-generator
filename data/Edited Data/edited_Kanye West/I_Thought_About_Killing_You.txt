i know, i know, i know, i know, know
i know, i know, i know, i know, know
i, i know it, i know it

the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
today, i seriously thought about killing you
i contemplated, premeditated murder
and i think about killing myself
and i love myself way more than i love you, so
today, i thought about killing you, premeditated murder
you'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
the most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(mhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm)
just say it out loud to see how it feels
people say "don't say this, don't say that"
just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
today, i thought about killing you, premeditated murder
i think about killing myself
and i, i love myself way more than i love you
the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(mhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm)
i think this is the part where i'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
but sometimes i think really bad things
really, really, really bad things
and i love myself way more than i love you
see, if i was tryin' to relate it to more people
i'd probably say i'm struggling with loving myself
because that seems like a common theme
but that's not the case here
i love myself way more than i love you
and i think about killing myself
so, best believe, i thought about killing you today
premeditated murder
i called up my loved ones, i called up my cousins
i called up the muslims, said i'm 'bout to go dumb
get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, i hear none
screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, i go numb
time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
set the newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
i need coke with no rum, i taste coke on her tongue
i don't joke with no one, they'll say "he died so young"
i done had a bad case of too many bad days
got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
i don't do shit halfway, i'ma clear the cache
i'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
it's a different type of rules that we obey
ye, ye, ye season, nigga, we old bay
we was all born to die, nigga, doa
niggas say they hero, mm, i don't see no cape
mm, i don't see no, mm, yeah, i don't see no, mm, mm
if i wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
sorry, but i chose not to be no slave
young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
i thought i was past my deebo ways
even when i went broke, i ain't break
how you gon' hate? nigga, we go way back
to when i had the braids and you had the wave cap
drop a pin for the fade and i'm on my way asap
don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
they wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
all you gotta do is speak on ye
all you gotta do is speak on ye
don't get your tooth chipped like frito-lay
