damn, your lips very soft
as i turn my blackberry off
and i turn your bathwater on
and you turn off your iphone
careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
your pussy's too good, i need to crash
your titties, let 'em out, free at last
thank god almighty, they free at last
we was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
had to stop at -eleven like i needed gas
i'm lyin', i needed condoms, don't look through the glass
chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
eatin' asian pussy, all i need was sweet and sour sauce
tell your boss you need an extra hour off
get you super wet after we turn the shower off


thats right, im in it
(shouldve known i would fall)
im in it
(steppin' on cracks on the floor)
thats right
(and your boys at your door)
thats right, im in it
(well, you need to fight for your own)
thats right, im in it
(then dont let me at your table)
im in it
(if you just gonna lay there)

(fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(i'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)
uh, picked up where we left off
uh, i need you home when i get off
uh, you know i need that wet mouth
uh, i know you need that reptile
uh, she cut from a different textile
uh, she love different kinds of sex now
uh, black girl sippin' white wine
put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
and grabbed it with a slight grind
and held it 'til the right time
then she came like aaaaahhh!

that's why i'm in it and i can't get out
that's all dem can do (say wah? say wah? say wah? say wah?)
that's why i'm in it and i can't get out
(that's all dem can do)
that's all dem can do
we deal with action ting
just a badman ting a-dat man do
that's right i'm in it
i'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes
time to take it too far now
uh, michael douglas out the car now
uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
uh, i'm so scared of my demons
uh, i go to sleep with a nightlight
uh, my mind move like a tron bike
uh, pop a wheelie on the zeitgeist
uh, i'm finna start a new movement
uh, being led by the drums
uh, i'm a rap-lic priest
uh, gettin' head by the nuns
uh, they don't play what i'm playin'
uh, they don't see what i'm sayin'
uh, they be ballin' in the d-league
uh, i be speakin' swaghili
