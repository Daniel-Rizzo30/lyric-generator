if i pull up with a kerry washington
that's gon' be an enormous scandal
i could have naomi campbell
and still might want me a stormy daniels
sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
i call that takin' corey gambles
find yourself up in the food court
you might have to enjoy a sample
all these thots on christian mingle
almost what got tristan single
if you don't ball like him or kobe
guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
ayy, time is extremely valuable
and i prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
that's just some ye shit
right now, let's do what we want
let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
i love your titties 'cause they prove
i can focus on two things at once

let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
ayy, if it ain't all about the income
ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some dri-fit
ayy, i'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
hm, mhm, if i see you pull up with the three stripes
ayy, ayy, i'ma fuck around and make you my bitch
