my big brother was b.i.g.'s brother
used to be dame and biggs' brother
who was hip hop brother, who was no i.d. friend
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin

it's the hard knock life tour, sellout
picture us in the mall, coppin' iceberg and yell out "jigga"
yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell 'bout
j-a-y, and 'ye so shy
that he won't even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind, "he could change your life
with all these beats i did, at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
but he got me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

big brother was b.i.g.'s brother
used to be dame and biggs' brother
who was hip hop brother, who was no i.d. friend
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why don't you wave your hands?
fresh off the plane, i'm off to baseline
nothing handed out, i'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that blueprint 
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
i'd play my little songs in that old back room
he'd bob his head and say "damn! oh, that's you?"
but by the black album, i was blacking out
partyin' s.o.b.'s and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and i'm like "yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
and kept little brother at bay, at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess i'll understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now i'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

my big brother was b.i.g.'s brother
used to be dame and biggs' brother
who was hip hop brother, who was no i.d. friend
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why don't you wave your hands?
have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
not only a client, the presidito, hola, hovito
the game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped "jesus walks" now i'm on the steeple
and we know, "new jack city"got to keep my brother
but to be number one i'ma beat my brother
on that "diamonds" remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry, only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin' me
at the grammys i said, "i inspired me"
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
i guess beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
and my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind i'm like, "damn, no way"
translate, español: "no way, josé"
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
my big brother was b.i.g.'s brother
so here's a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
a idol in my eyes, god of the game
heart of the city, roc-a-fella chain
never be the same, never be another
number one, young hov, also my big brother

my big brother was b.i.g.'s brother
used to be dame and biggs' brother
who was hip hop brother, who was no i.d. friend
no i.d., my mentor, and that's where the story ends
