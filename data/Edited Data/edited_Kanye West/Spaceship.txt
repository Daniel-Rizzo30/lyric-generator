i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit (yeah, yeah)
i wish i could (me too)
buy me a spaceship and fly (swear i do)
past the sky, oh
glc feel you, babyi feel you, man
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could
buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky (man, man, man...)
oh, oh, oh
if my manager insults me again
i will be assaulting him
after i fuck the manager up
then, i'm gonna shorten the register up
let's go back, back to the gap
look at my checkwasn't no scratch
so if i stole, wasn't my fault
yeah, i stolenever got caught
they take me to the back and pat me
asking me about some khakis
but let some black people walk in
i bet you they show off their token blackie
oh, now they love kanye
"let's put him all in the front of the store"
so i'm on break
next to the "no smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
taking my hits, writing my hits
writing my rhymes, playing my mind
this fucking job can't help him
so i quit; y'all welcome
y'all don't know my struggle
y'all can't match my hustle
you can't catch my hustle
you can't fathom my love, dude
lock yourself in a room
doing five beats a day for three summers
that's a different world like cree summer's
i deserve to do these numbers
"the kid that made that deserves that maybach!"
so many records in my basement
i'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky, oh
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky
tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
oh, oh (let's go, ugh)

i've been working this grave-shift
aww, man, this pressure
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could
buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky, oh
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could
buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky
oh, oh, oh
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could
buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky, oh
i've been working this grave-shift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could
buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky
oh, oh, oh
