i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die, i'ma touch the sky
gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die, i'ma touch the sky

back when they thought pink polos would hurt the roc
before cam got the shit to pop
the doors was closed
i felt like bad boy's street team: i couldn't work the locks
now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
me and my momma hopped in that u-haul van
any pessimists, i ain't talk to them
plus i ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
let's take 'em back to the club
least about an hour i stand on line
i just wanted to dance, i went to jacob an hour
after i got my advance, i just wanted to shine
jay favorite line: "dawg, in due time!"
now he look at me, like, "damn, dawg! you where i am!"
a hip-hop legend
i think i died in that accident, cause this must be heaven
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die, i'ma touch the sky
gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die, i'ma touch the sky

now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
a-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
a-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

back when gucci was the shit to rock
back when slick rick got the shit to pop
i'd do anything to say i got it
damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
before anybody wanted k. west beats
me and my girl split the buffet at kfc
dog, i was havin' nervous breakdowns
like "man, these niggas that much better than me?"
baby, i'm goin' on an aeroplane
and i don't know if i'll be back again
sure enough, i sent the plane tickets
but when she came to kick it, things became different
any girl i cheated on, sheets i skeeted on
couldn't keep it at home, thought i needed a nia long
i'm tryin' to right my wrongs
but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
you gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
you gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
