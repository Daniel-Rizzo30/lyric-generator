i've been waiting on this my whole life (and i wonder)
these dreams be waking me up at night (and i wonder)
you say i think i'm never wrong (and i wonder)
you know what? maybe you're right, aight?


you say he get on your fucking nerves (and i wonder)
you hope that he get what he deservesword! (and i wonder)
do you even remember what the issue is?
you just trying to find where the tissue is
you can still be who you wish you is
it ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (and i wonder)
when you hop back in the car
drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
the smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
you ever wonder what it all really means?

and i'm back on my grind
a psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
my name would help light up the chicago skyline
and that's why i'm (and i wonder)
seven o'clock, that's primetime
heaven'll watch, god calling from the hotlines
why he keep giving me hot lines?
i'm a star, how could i not shine? (and i wonder)
how many ladies in the house? (if you know)
how many ladies in the house without a spouse? (what it means)
something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
what you about? (and i wonder)
on that independent shit (if you know)
trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)
you ever wonder what it all really mean?
you wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
(to find your dreams come true
