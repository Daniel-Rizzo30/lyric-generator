i need to call it off
i need to, i need to make it known
'nother one, something gone
capricorn
dancing out on the lawn
fancy like the things she likes
she lives her life
i'm living mine


maybe it's 'cause she into leos and i was into trios
plus all the trips to rio couldn't have helped
it's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
and i'm feelin' it right now
'cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
your feelings like zulu, then nothing is a shaka
i hit her with jamaican dick, i'm the new shabba
she lookin' for her daddy, call me big poppa
on to the next saga
focus on the future and let the crew knock her
star wars fur, yeah, i'm rockin' chewbacca
the one chief rocka, number-one chief rocka
