i don't feel that she's mine enough
god, i feel i couldn't have you windin' up
butterfly in my wrist
you make pretty women out of my skin
and i don't feel like
and i know you wouldn't leave

they say, "build your own"i said, "how, sway?"
i said, "slavery a choice"they said, "how, ye?"
just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
now i'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
my wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

and i know you wouldn't leave

and i know you wouldn't...

oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
you know i'm sensitive, i got a gentle mental
every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
we had an incident, but i cover incidentals
you want me workin' on my messagin'
when i'm thinkin' like george jetson
but soundin' like george jefferson
then they questionin' my methods then
if you tweakin' out on my texts again
then i don't get reception here
i got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
i use the same attitude that done got us here
i live for now, i don't know what happen after here
i live for now, i don't know what happen after here
plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
even if, publicly, i lack the empathy
i ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
one and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

and i know you wouldn't...

for any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
she told you not to do that shit (ohh)
she told you you's gon' fuck the money up
but you ain't wanna listen, did you?
keep that same energy
keep that same energy
keep that same energy
now you testin' her loyalty
this what they mean when they say
"for better or for worse", huh?
for every down female that stuck with they dude
through the best times, through the worst times
this for you

and i know you wouldn't leave
