niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
father, forgive me, i'm scared of the karma
'cause now i see women as somethin' to nurture
not somethin' to conquer
i hope she like nicki, i make her a monster
not havin' m√©nages, i'm just bein' silly
i answered the door like will smith and martin
nigga, do we have a problem?
matter fact, marlon, this ain't meet the fockers
i'll beat his ass, pray i beat the charges
no, daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
just play piano and stick to karate
i pray your body's draped more like mine
and not like your mommy's
just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
and i am a nigga, i know what they want
i pray that you don't get it all at once
curves under your dress, i know it's pervs all on the net
all in the comments, you wanna vomit
that's your baby, you love her to death
now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
you break a glass and say it again
she can't comprehend the danger she in
if you whoop her ass, she move in with him
then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
but how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
let's pray we can put this behind us
i swear that these times is the wildest
she got the scars, they serve as reminders
blood still on her pajamas
but yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
