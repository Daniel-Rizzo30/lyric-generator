father, i stretch
stretch my hands to you

lifelike, this is what your life like, try toliveyour life right
peoplereally know you, push your buttonslike typewrite
this is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
every single night, right, every single fight, right?
i was looking at the 'gram and i don't even like likes
i was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "it ain't christ-like"
i was screamin' at the referee just like mike
lookin' for a bright light, sigel, what your life like
riding on a white bike, feeling like excitebike (stretch my hands to you)
pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
screamin' at my dad and he told me, "it ain't christ-like"
but nobody never tell you when you're being like christ
only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
like if tyler perry made a movie for bet
searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "it ain't christ-like" (stretch my hands to you)
i'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
i'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
i don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (father, i stretch)
wrestlin' with god, i don't really want to wrestle
man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (stretch my hands to you)
arguing with my dad, and he said, "it ain't christ-like"
