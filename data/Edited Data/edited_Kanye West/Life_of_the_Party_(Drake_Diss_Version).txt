verse from drake's radio show on siriusxm

it's after hours at that glamorous blind spot
where they'retakingit easy, swappingpersonal experiences
let's listen in america today
lifeof the party, mhm, 'til i almost cry, mhm
it's thelifeofthe party tothink i could'vealmost died
lord, help us

mama, your son in the red hat
had suffered set-backs, had, "shouldn't-have-said-thats"
had made everyone mad
he made "s" so he's everyone dad, know he ever gets sad
hotel rooms by the shore, close my eyes, i can see more
nobody punkin' me, nobody pressure me, nobody gangsta me
especially when the gangstas eat thanks to me
and my favorite principal name was mrs. wooten
she was strict, the perfect instructor for young putin
vladimir, just so that is clear
whom should we fear when we know dad is here?
daddy's right here, daddy's right here
i don't play, boy
over y'all dead body 'fore my daughter pose in playboy
we don't condone over-sexualization of the kids in the home
battery in my back
this house of pain won't ever last
cyhi told me to my face that "sicko mode" was his biggest song
well go'n 'cause donda was the best ghostwriter i ever had
south park had jokes about fish sticks
'til this day, the whole team can kiss this dick
i put virgil and drake on the same text
and it wasn't about the matching arc'teryx or kid cudi dress
just told these grown men, "stop it with the funny shit"
i might hire the whole team from acg
so don't text me like i'm juanita jcv
or more important, monica corgan, who was there for me
somebody really there for me was rare for me
that was new air to breathe
when i was underappreciated, undervaluated
stockholders told me, "board rooms will bore you"
can't remember going by your rules, try to follow the lord's rules
thought we was the new abu dhabi
told drake don't play with me on gd
and he sent that message to everybody
so if i hit you with a "w-y-d"
you better hit me with, "yes sir, i'm writing everything you need"
i told you i was gonna take the summer back
so any of the cap, won't take none of that
where my motherfuckin' red hat?
security and the nannies be forever handling
i can't stand it when there's talks about puttin' the kids back in
sierra canyon when daddy got his own school
trav, smile for these white people if you want (c'mon)
while we build a team to get hoover out the joint
i do what i want, bro, in my life
serve and protect long as it's my wife
screaming on m-a-n's for trying to lower the percentage of skims
see, i was going in
back when they thought i was only making ms, now it's nine-billi'
you ain't gotta like me, but you feel me
do y'all feel me? really?
get off scott free, i'm talking ridley
get off our knees, that's if you're with me
get off your knees, that's if you're with me
get off your knees and let's get free
get off your knees and let's get free
really, i mean really
really, i mean really
i need release, i don't need police
i'm like, "nigga, please"
y'all can't hear me, (harmonizing), for the real me
for the real me, i mean, mhmm-mm
