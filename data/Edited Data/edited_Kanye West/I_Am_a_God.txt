i am a god
i am a god
i am a god

i am a god
hurry up with my damn massage
hurry up with my damn m√©nage
get the porsche out the damn garage
i am a god
even though i'm a man of god
my whole life in the hand of god
so y'all better quit playin' with god
soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
the only rapper compared to michael
so here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
and here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
and i don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
old niggas mentally still in high school
since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
but everybody know you brought real rap back
nobody had swag, man, we the rat pack
virgil, pyrex, don c snapback
ibn diamond, chi-town shinin'
monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
hop in this bitch to give saint the garment
until the day i get struck by lightning

i am a god
so hurry up with my damn massage
in a french-ass restaurant
hurry up with my damn croissants
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god
ahh!
ahh!

i just talked to jesus
he said, "what up, yeezus?"
i said, "shiti'm chillin'
tryna stack these millions"
i know he the most high
but i am a close high
mi casa, su casa
that's our cosa nostra
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god

ahh!
ahh!
ahh!
ahh!
