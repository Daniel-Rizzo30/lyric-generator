boom, b-boom, b-boom-boom

drive slow, homie
drive slow, homie
you never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

my homie mali used to stay at th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet, a school full of stones
he nicknamed me "k-rock" so they'd leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
back when we rocked ellesses, he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers, even more by polices
how'd he get the cash? the day his father passed away
left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
al b. sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
hit lake shore, girls go all crazy
hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
see back back then then, if you had a car
you was the chi-town version of baby
and i was just a virgin, a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
felt like i was almost signed when the shit got cranked
we'd take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had them lincolns and au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all
with the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog
fuck all that flirtingnow, i'm tryna get in some drawers
so put me on with these hoes, homie
he told me, "don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie"
drive slow, homie
(drive slow)
you never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie


turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
drive slow, homie
if you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
drive slow, homie
live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
you never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
my car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
i got more tvs in here than where i live
and that don't make no sense, but baby, i'm the shit
and everything i flip, you know it's something serious
i got the custom grill, i got the brabus rims
i got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
you see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
that you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
i wear my custom kicks, i got my jesus chain
my canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
they see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
with that mean lean, smoking on that finest cali green
my woodgrain oak, i'm riding on vogues
my cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
i sold o's, and this i know
when you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

yeah
