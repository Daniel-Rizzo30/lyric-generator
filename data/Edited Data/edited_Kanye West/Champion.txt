yes, i did
so i packed it up and brought it back to the crib
just a little something, show you how we live
everybody want it but it ain't that serious
mhm, that's that shit
so if you gon' do it, do it just like this


you don't see just how wild the crowd is
you don't see just how fly my style is
i don't see why i need a stylist
when i shop so much i can speak italian
i don't know, i just want it better for my kids
and i ain't sayin' we was from the projects
but every time i wanted layaway or a deposit
my dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids"
we was sort of like will smith and his son
in the movie, i ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'cause every summer he'd get some
brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
and i don't know what he did for dough
but he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy

i think he did
when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
just a little something, show you how we live
everything i wanted, man it seem so serious
mhm, that's that shit
so if you gon' do it, do it just like this


when it feel like living's harder than dyin'
for me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
lauryn hill said her heart was in zion
i wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
i guess me if it isn't you
last week i paid a visit to the institute
they got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
i guess i cleaned up my act like prince'd do
if not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
they got the cd, they got to see me
drop gems like i dropped out of pe
they used to feel invisible
now they know they invincible
this is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
stand up, stand up, here he comes
tell me what it takes to be number one
tell me what it takes to be number one
this is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
stand up, stand up, here he comes
tell me what it takes to be number one
tell me what it takes to be number one


yes i did
