it feels good to be home
and to all of you, i thank you so much for your support
for your support of me for so many years
and more importantly, for the work you continue to do
what do you want me to talk about?
well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
he told me i could talk about anything i wanted to
and you know, i am my son's mother
the man i describe in the introduction as being so decidedly different
my son (when you're runnin' outta timе and you're not outta time)
and what made thе project extra special to me is
i got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
but what he has meant to a generation (change the time)
as one writer said, we came from somewhere
not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
but from a long line of generations who came before us

forever, yeah
forever, yeah
forever, forever, no
oh yeah, glory, glory, glory
what did i teach him? (glory)
and why kanye ain't scared
