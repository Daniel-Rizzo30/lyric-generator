somethin' wrong, i hold my head
mj gone, our nigga dead
i slapped my girl, she called the feds
i did that time and spent that bread
i'm heading home, i'm almost there
i'm on my way, heading up the stairs
to my surprise, a nigga replacing me
i had to take him to that ghetto university
(all of the lights), lights
cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
strobe lights, street lights (all of the lights, all of the lights)
fast life, drug life, thug life
rock life every night (all of the lights)

restraining order, can't see my daughter
her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
public visitation, we met at borders
told her she take me back, i'll be more supportive
i made mistakes, i bumped my head
them courts sucked me dry, i spent that bread
she need her daddy, baby, please
can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

(all of the lights), lights
cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
strobe lights, street lights (all of the lights, all of the lights)
fast life, drug life, thug life
rock life every night (all of the lights)
