bitch, i'm back out my coma, wakin' up on your sofa
when i parked my range rover, slightly scratched your corolla
okay, i smashed your corolla
i'm hangin' on a hangover, five years we been over
ask me why i came over, one more hit and i can own ya
one more fuck and i can own ya, one cold night in october
pussy had me floatin', feel like deepak chopra
pussy had me dead, might call pac over
yeezy's all on your sofa, these the red octobers
still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when i ain't sober
you love me when i'm hungover, even when i blow doja
then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
tellin' you that i'm bogus, bitch, you don't even know us
"baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner"
late-night organ donor, after that, he disown ya
after that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
"when it's over it's over," and, bitch, i'm back out my coma


i heard you need a new fad (a new girl, a new girl)
i heard you need a new stack (a new girl, a new girl)
i heard you need a new phone (a new girl, a new girl)
i know your 'rents ain't be home (a new girl, a new girl)

callin' up your uncle's place (a new girl, a new girl)
shit's all over the place (a new girl, a new girl)
i don't hear your phone (a new girl, a new girl)
oh, i wanna phone home (a new girl, a new girl
