and disciplinary remains mercifully
yes and um, im with you derek, this star nonsense
yes, yes, now which is it?
i am sure of it

so, so you think you can tell
heaven from hell? blue skies from pain?
can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
a smile from a veil? do you think you can tell?
did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
hot ashes for trees? hot air for a cool breeze?
cold comfort for change? did you exchange
a walk-on part in the war
for a lead role in a cage?


how i wish, how i wish you were here
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
running over the same old ground, what have we found?
the same old fears, wish you were here
