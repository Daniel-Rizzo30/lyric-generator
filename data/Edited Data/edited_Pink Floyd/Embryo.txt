all is love, is all i am
a ball is all i am
i'm so new compared to you
and i am very small

warm glow, moon bloom
always need a little more room
waiting here seems like years
never seen the light of day

all around i hear strange sounds
come gurgling in my ear
red the light and dark the night
i feel my dawn is near

warm glow, moon gloom
always need a little more room
whisper low, here i go
i will see the sunshine show
