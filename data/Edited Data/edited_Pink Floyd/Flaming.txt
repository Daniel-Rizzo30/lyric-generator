alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown

yippee! you cant see me
but i can you

lazing in the foggy dew
sitting on a unicorn

no fair, you cant hear me
but i can you

watching buttercups cup the light
sleeping on a dandelion

too much, i wont touch you
but then i might

screaming through the starlit sky
traveling by telephone
hey, ho, here we go
ever so high

alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown

yippee! you cant see me
but i can you
