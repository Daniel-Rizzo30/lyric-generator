scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
blam blam your pointers point your pointers
waddle with apples to crunchy mrs. stores
she'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
flat tops of houses, mouses, houses
fiddle and diddle sitting bat tat tat
watching the telly till all hours - telly time!
fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter

scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
blam blam your pointers point your pointers
waddle with apples to crunchy mrs. stores
she'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
