if i were a swan, i'd be gone
if i were a train, i'd be late
and if i were a good man
i'd talk with you more often than i do

if i were asleep, i could dream
if i were afraid, i could hide
if i go insane
please don't put your wires in my brain

if i were the moon, i'd be cool
if i were a rule, i would bend
if i were a good man
i'd understand the spaces between friends

if i were alone, i would cry
and if i were with you, i'd be home and dry
and if i go insane
will you still let me join in with the game?

if i were a swan, i'd be gone
if i were a train, i'd be late again
if i were a good man
i'd talk with you more often than i do
