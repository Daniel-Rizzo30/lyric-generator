hey you
out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
can you feel me?
hey you
standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
can you feel me?
hey you
don't help them to bury the light
don't give in without a fight

hey you
out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
would you touch me?
hey you
with your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
could you touch me?
hey you
would you help me to carry the stone?
open your heart, i'm coming home
but it was only fantasy
the wall was too high, as you can see
no matter how he tried, he could not break free
and the worms ate into his brain

hey you
out there on the road, always doing what you're told
can you help me?
hey you
out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
can you help me?
hey you
don't tell me there's no hope at all
together we stand, divided we fall

(we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall
