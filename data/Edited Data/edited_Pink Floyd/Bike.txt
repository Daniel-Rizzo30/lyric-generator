ive got a bike, you can ride it if you like
its got a basket, a bell that rings
and things to make it look good
id give it to you if i could, but i borrowed it

youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world
ill give you anything, everything if you want things

ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke
theres a tear up the front
its red and black, ive had it for months
if you think it could look good, then i guess it should

youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world
ill give you anything, everything if you want things

youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world
ill give you anything, everything if you want things
ive got a clan of gingerbread men
here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men

youre the kind of girl that fits in with my world
ill give you anything, everything if you want things
