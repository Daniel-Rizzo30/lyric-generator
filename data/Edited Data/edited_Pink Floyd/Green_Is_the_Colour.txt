heavy hung the canopy of blue
shade my eyes and i can see you
white is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

she lay in the shadow of the wave
hazy were the visions of her playing
sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind evry time

green is the colour of her kind
quickness of the eye deceives the mind
envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
