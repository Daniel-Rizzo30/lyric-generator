we bitch and we fight
diss each other on sight
but this thing we do
these times together
rain or shine or stormy weather
this thing we do
with world-weary grace
we've taken our places
we could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
or stay home by the fire, felled by desire
stoking the flame
but were here for the ride
it's louder than words
this thing that we do
louder than words
the way it unfurls
it's louder than words
the sum of our parts
the beat of our hearts
is louder than words
louder than words
the strings bend and slide
as the hours glide by
an old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
gonna tap out the rhythm
let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
we're more than alive

it's louder than words
this thing that we do
louder than words
the way it unfurls
it's louder than words
the sum of our parts
the beat of our hearts
is louder than words
louder than words
this thing they call soul
is there with a pulse
louder than words
louder than words
