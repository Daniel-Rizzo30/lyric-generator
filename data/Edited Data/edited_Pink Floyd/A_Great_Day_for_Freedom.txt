on the day the wall came down
they threw the locks onto the ground
and with glasses high we raised a cry
for freedom had arrived
on the day the wall came down
the ship of fools had finally run aground
promises lit up the night
like paper doves in flight

i dreamed you had left my side
no warmth, not even pride remained
and even though you needed me
it was clear that i could not do a thing for you

now life devalues day by day
as friends and neighbors turn away
and theres a change that even with regret
cannot be undone
now frontiers shift like desert sands
while nations wash their bloodied hands
of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

i woke to the sound of drums
the music played, the morning sun streamed in
i turned and i looked at you
and all but the bitter residues slipped away
slipped away
