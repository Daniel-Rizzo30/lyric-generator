far, far, far, far away  way
people heard him say  say
i will find a way  way
there will come a day  day
something will be done

then at last the mighty ship
descending on a point of flame
made contact with the human race at mildenhall

now, now, now is the time  time
time to be  be  be aware

carters father saw him there and
knew the road revealed to him
the living soul of hereward the wake

oh, my, something in my eye  eye
something in the sky  sky
waiting there for me
the outer lock rolled slowly back
the service men were heard to sigh
for there revealed in glowing robes was lucy in the sky

oh, oh, did you ever know  know
never ever will they
i cannot say

summoning his cosmic powers
and glowing slightly from his toes
his psychic emanations flowed
