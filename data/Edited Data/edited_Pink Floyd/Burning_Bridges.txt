bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
flickering between the lines
stolen moments floating softly on the air
born on wings of fire and climbing higher

ancient bonds are breaking
moving on and changing sides
dreaming of a new day
cast aside the other way
(magic vision stirring
kindled by and burning
flames rise in her eyes)

the door that stands ajar
the walls that once were high
beyond the gilded cage
beyond the reach of ties
the moment is at hand
she breaks the golden band
