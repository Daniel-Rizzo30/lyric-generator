good morning, worm your honour
the crown will plainly show the prisoner
who now stands before you
was caught red-handed showing feelings
showing feelings of an almost human nature
this will not do
call the schoolmaster!

i always said he'd come to no good in the end your honour
if they'd let me have my way i could have flayed him into shape
but my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists
let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

crazy, toys in the attic
i am crazy, truly gone fishing
they must have taken my marbles away!
(crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)
you little shit, you're in it now, i hope they throw away the key
you should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
you had to go your own way
have you broken any homes up lately?
"just five minutes, worm your honour, him and me, alone"
babe!
come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
m'lud i never wanted him to get in any trouble
why'd he ever have to leave me?
worm, your honour, let me take him home

crazy, over the rainbow
i am crazy, bars in the window
there must have been a door there in the wall
when i came in
(crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

the evidence before the court is incontrovertible
there's no need for the jury to retire
in all my years of judging, i have never heard before
of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
the way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
fills me with the urge to defecate
(go on, judge, shit on him!)
since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
i sentence you to be exposed before your peers
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
tear down the wall!
