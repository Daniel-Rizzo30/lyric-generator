did you know
it was all going to go so wrong for you?
and did you see
it was all going to be so right for me?
why did we tell you then
you were always the golden boy then
and that you'd never lose that light in your eyes?

hey you
did you ever realize what you'd become?
and did you see
that it wasn't only me you were running from?
did you know all the time but it
never bothered you anyway?
leading the blind while i stared out the steel in your eyes


the rain fell slow
down on all the roofs of uncertainty
i thought of you
and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
and did you know?
(did you know, did you know, did you know)
(did you know, did you know, did you know)
(did you know, did you)
i never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes
