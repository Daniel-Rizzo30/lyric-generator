all alone, or in twos
the ones who really love you
walk up and down, outside the wall
some hand in hand
and some gathered together in bands
the bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
and when they've given you their all
some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall
isn't this where
