following the path as it leads towards
the darkness in the north
weary strangers faces show their sympathy
theyve seen that hope before

and if you want to stay for a little bit
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
for you the night is beckoning
and now you cant delay
you hear the night birds calling you
but you cant catch the words they say
close your ears and eyes, be on your way

mist is swirling, creatures crawling
hear the roar get louder in your ears
you know the folly was your own
but the force behind cant conquer all you fears
and if you want to stay for a little bit
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
for you the night is beckoning
and now you cant delay
you hear the night birds calling you
but you cant catch the words they say
close your ears and eyes, be on your way

throw your thoughts back many years
to the time when love was life with every morning
perhaps a day will come
when the lights will be as clear as on that morning

and if you want to stay for a little bit
rest your aching limbs for a little bit
for you the night is beckoning
and now you cant delay
you hear the night birds calling you
but you cant catch the words they say
close your ears and eyes, be on your way
