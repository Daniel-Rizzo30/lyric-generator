lucifer sam, siam cat
always sitting by your side
always by your side

that cats something i cant explain

jennifer gentle, youre a witch
youre the left side, hes the right side
oh, no!

that cats something i cant explain

lucifer, go to sea
be a hip cat, be a ships cat
somewhere, anywhere

that cats something i cant explain

at night prowling, sifting sand
hiding around on the ground
hell be found when youre around
that cats something i cant explain
