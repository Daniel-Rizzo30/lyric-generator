into the distance, a ribbon of black
stretched to the point of no turning back
a flight of fancy on a windswept field
standing alone, my senses reel
a fatal attraction is holding me fast
how can i escape this irresistible grasp?

can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
tongue-tied and twisted
just an earthbound misfit, i

ice is forming on the tips of my wings
unheeded warnings, i thought i thought of everything
no navigator to find my way home
unladen, empty and turned to stone

a soul in tension that's learning to fly
condition grounded but determined to try

can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
tongue-tied and twisted
just an earthbound misfit, i
above the planet on a wing and a prayer
my grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
across the clouds i see my shadow fly
out of the corner of my watering eye
a dream unthreatened by the morning light
could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

there's no sensation to compare with this
suspended animation, a state of bliss

can't keep my mind from the circling skies
tongue-tied and twisted
just an earthbound misfit, i
