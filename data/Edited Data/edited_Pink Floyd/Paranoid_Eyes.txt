button your lip and dont let the shield slip
take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask
and if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
you can hide, hide, hide
behind paranoid eyes
you put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
laughing too loud at the rest of the world
with the boys in the crowd
you can hide, hide, hide
(ill tell you what, ill give you three blacks, and play you for five")
behind petrified eyes

(ta! you was unlucky there son)
you believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory
now youre lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
the pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
and you hide, hide, hide
(time gentleman!)
behind brown and mild eyes
oi
