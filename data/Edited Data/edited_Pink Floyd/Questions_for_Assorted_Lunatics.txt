people often ask me about the voices on dark side. i was trying to gather audio snippets to mix into segues on dark side. rather than interviewing people i came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. the cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. we would scour abbey road studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order.

as i recall the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like whats your favourite colour? and the last was the more enigmatic what do you think of the dark side of the moon?

i cant remember the ones in between, except for:
are you afraid of dying?
when were you last violent?
were you in the right?
do you ever think youre going mad?
if so why?
