i was standing by the nile
when i saw the lady smile
i would take her out for a while
for a while

like tears left like a child
how her golden hair was blowing wild
then she spread her wings to fly
for to fly

soaring high above the breezes
going always where she pleases
she will make it to the islands in the sun

i will follow in her shadow
as i watch her from my window
one day i will catch her eye

she is calling from the deep
summoning my soul to endless sleep
she is bound to drag me down
drag me down
