corporal clegg had a wooden leg
he won it in the war
in 
corporal clegg had a medal too
in orange, red, and blue
he found it in the zoo
dear oh dear oh were they really sad for me?
dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?

mrs. clegg, you must be proud of him
mrs. clegg, another drop of gin?

corporal clegg umbrella in the rain
hes never been the same
no one is to blame
corporal clegg received his medal in a dream
from her majesty the queen
his boots were very clean

mrs. clegg, you must be proud of him
mrs. clegg, another drop of gin?
corporal clegg, corporal clegg, corporal clegg
