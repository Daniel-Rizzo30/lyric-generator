last night i had too much to drink
sitting in a club with so many fools
playing to rules
trying to impress but feeling rather empty
i had another drink (drink  a  drink  a  drink  a  drink)
(ah)

what a way to spend that evening
they all turn up with their friends
playing the game
they're in the scene i should have been
far away (away  away  away  away  away)

getting up, i feel as if im remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

the telephone rings and someone speaks
she would very much like to go out to a show
so what can i do?  i cant think what to say
she sees through anyway (away  away  away  away  away)
out of the front door i go
traffics moving rather slow
arriving late
there she waits, looking very angry
as cross as she can be (be  a  be  a  be  a  be  a  be)

getting up, i feel as if im remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget
