aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
and i rutted down by the hade and the furrow
well, i slipped me in a flop and hit down and i shied
and i cried, cried, cried
the fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
and then cried 'mary!' and i tucked up
wi' a claymore out and about
and i run down, down the mechyn sty
and beckoned the fiery whore
that was fallin' around the feet
"never", i cried. "never shall ye get me alive
ya rotten hound of the burnie brae"
well, i snapped for a blade and a claymore cut and thrust
and i fell down before him 'round his feet
(that was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?)
aye, a roar he cried! frae the bottom of his heart
that i would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah...
and the wind cried mary

thank you
