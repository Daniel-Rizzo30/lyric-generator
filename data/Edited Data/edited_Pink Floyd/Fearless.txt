you say the hills too steep to climb
chiding
you say youd like to see me try
climbing
you pick the place and ill choose the time

and i will climb that hill in my own way
just wait a while for the right day
and as i rise above the tree line and the clouds
i look down, hearing the sound of the things youve said today

fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
smiling
merciless the magistrate turns round
frowning
and whos the fool who wears the crown?

and go down in your own way
and every day is the right day
and as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
you look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd
walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never walk alone
