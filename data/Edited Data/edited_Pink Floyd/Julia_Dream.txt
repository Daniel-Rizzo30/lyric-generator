sunlight bright upon my pillow
lighter than an eiderdown
will she let the weeping willow
wind his branches round?

julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams

every night i turn the light out
waiting for the velvet bride
will the scaly armadillo
find me where im hiding?

julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams

will the misty master break me?
will the key unlock my mind?
will the following footsteps catch me?
am i really dying?
julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams

julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams
(please save me!)
julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams
(please save me!)
julia dream, dreamboat queen
queen of all my dreams
(please save me
