the black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
he didnt care

he stood in a field where barley grows

his head did no thinking
his arms didnt move except when the wind cut up rough
and mice ran around on the ground

he stood in a field where barley grows

the black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
but now hes resigned to his fate
cause lifes not unkind  he doesnt mind

he stood in a field where barley grows
