her love rains down on me
easy as the breeze
i listen to her breathing
it sounds like the waves on the sea
i was thinking all about her
burning with rage and desire
we were spinning into darkness
the earth was on fire

she could take it back
she might take it back someday

so i spy on her, i lie to her
i make promises i cannot keep
then i hear their laughter rising, rising from the deep
and i make her prove her love for me, i take all that i can take
and i push her to the limit to see if she will break

she might take it back, she could take it back some day

ring-a-ring o roses
a pocket full of posies
a-tishoo! a-tishoo!
we all fall down

now i have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
its easy to ignore them, god knows ive tried
all of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
until i couldnt see the danger or hear the rising tide

she can take it back, she will take it back some day
she can take it back, she will take it back some day
she will take it back, she will take it back some day
