oh my, girl sitting in the sun
go buy, candy and a currant bun
i like, to see you run
like that......

oooh, don't talk to me
please, just fuck with me
please, you know i'm feeling frail

it's true, sun shining very bright
it's you, who i'm gonna love tonight
ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon

oooh, don't touch me child
please, you know you drive me wild
please, you know i'm feeling frail
don't try another cat
don't go where other you must know why
very, very, very frail

oh my, girl sitting in the sun
go buy, candy and a currant bun
i like, to see you run
like that
