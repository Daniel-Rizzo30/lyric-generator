there was a king who ruled the land
his majesty was in command
with silver eyes the scarlet eagle
showered silver on the people...

oh, mother
tell me more

whyd'ya have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air
waiting?
you only have to read the lines
theyre scribbly black and everything shines

across the stream with wooden shoes
with bells to tell the king the news
a thousand misty riders climb up
higher once upon a time

wandering and dreaming
the words have different meaning
yes, they did

for all the time spent in that room
the dolls house, darkness, old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by

oh, mother
tell me more
tell me more

aaaaaaaah
aaaaaaaah
aaaaaaaah
