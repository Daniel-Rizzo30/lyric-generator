you shout in your sleep
perhaps the price is just too steep
is your conscience at rest
if once put to the test?
you awake with a start
to just the beating of your heart
just one man beneath the sky
just two ears, just two eyes

you set sail across the sea
of long past thoughts and memories
childhoods end, your fantasies
merge with harsh realities
and then as the sail is hoist
you find your eyes are growing moist
all the fears never voiced
say you have to make your final choice

who are you and who am i
to say we know the reason why?
some are born; some men die
beneath one infinite sky
therell be war, therell be peace
but everything one day will cease
all the iron turned to rust
all the proud men turned to dust
and so all things, time will mend
so this song will end
