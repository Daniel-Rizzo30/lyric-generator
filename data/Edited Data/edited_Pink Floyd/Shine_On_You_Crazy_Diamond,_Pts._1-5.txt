remember when you were young
you shone like the sun

shine on, you crazy diamond

now there's a look in your eyes
like black holes in the sky

shine on, you crazy diamond

you were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
blown on the steel breeze
come on, you target for faraway laughter
come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine
you reached for the secret too soon
you cried for the moon

shine on, you crazy diamond

threatened by shadows at night
and exposed in the light

shine on (shine on), you crazy diamond (you crazy diamond)

well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
rode on the steel breeze
come on, you raver, you seer of visions
come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine
