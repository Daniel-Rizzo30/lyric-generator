one, two, free, four!

the memories of a man in his old age
are the deeds of a man in his prime
you shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
and talk to yourself as you die

life is a short, warm moment
and death is a long, cold rest
you get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
eighty years, with luck, or even less

so all aboard for the american tour
and maybe youll make it to the top
and mind how you go, and i can tell you, cause i know
you may find it hard to get off


you are the angel of death
and i am the dead mans son
and he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
and everyone is still on the run
and who is the master of fox hounds?
and who says the hunt has begun?
and who calls the tune in the courtroom?
and who beats the funeral drum?

the memories of a man in his old age
are the deeds of a man in his prime
you shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
and talk to yourself as you die
