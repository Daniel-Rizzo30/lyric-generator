i'm so afraid
of all the mistakes that i've made
shaking every time that i awake
i feel like a cardboard cut-out man

so build me a time
when the characters rhyme
and the story line is kind

i've aged and aged since the first page
i've lived every line that you wrote
take me down, take me down
from the shelf above your head

and build me a time
when the characters rhyme
and the story line is kind

i live where i'm left
on the shelf like the rest
and the epilogue reads like a sad song
please pick up your camera
and use me again
and build me a time
when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind
yeaaaah
