jesus, jesus, whats it all about?
trying to clout these little ingrates into shape
when i was their age all the lights went out
there was no time to whine and mope about
and even now part of me flies over
dresden at angels one five
though theyll never fathom it behind my
sarcasm desperate memories lie
sweetheart, sweetheart, are you fast asleep? good
cause thats the only time that i can really speak to you
and there is something that ive locked away
a memory that is too painful
to withstand the light of day
when we came back from the war
the banners and flags hung on everyones door
we danced and we sang in the street and
the church bells rang
but the burning in my heart
the memory smolders on
of the gunner's dying words on the intercom
