come on, my friends
lets make for the hills
they say theres gold and im looking for thrills
you can get your hands on whatever we find
because im only coming along for the ride

well, you go your way
ill go mine
i dont care if we get there on time
everybodys searching for something, they say
ill get my kicks on the way

over the mountains, across the sea
who knows what will be waiting for me?
i could sail forever to strange sounding names
faces of people and places dont change

all i have to do is just close my eyes
to see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
all i want to tell you, all i want to say
is count me in on the journey
dont expect me to stay
