gotta be crazy, you gotta be mean
gotta keep your shoes and your car clean
gotta keep smiling, you gotta keep fit
you gotta keep drinking, you gotta eat shit
you gotta be small to be a big shot
gotta eat meat to stay at the top
you gotta be trusted, you gotta tell lies
gotta be able to narrow your eyes
you gotta believe they gotta believe you
gotta appear easy to see through
gotta be sure you look good on tv
gotta resemble a human being
you gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
gonna get harder as you get older
gotta fly south and hide in the sand
gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer


and when you lose control
you'll reap the harvest you have sown
and as the fear grows
the bad blood slows and turns to stone
and it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
so have a good drown as you go down
all alone
dragged down by the stone
you've gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
gotta divide the tame from the sick
gotta keep all of us docile and fit
gotta keep everyone buying this shit
they gotta get you started early
processed by the time you're thirty
you work like fuck until you're sixty-five
and time's your own until you die
gotta admit to a lot of confusion
pain in the head is the child of collusion
gotta resist this creeping malaise
gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze
but you, you just keep on pretending
you can tell a sucker from a friend
but you still raise the knife
stranger, lover, friend and foe alike
