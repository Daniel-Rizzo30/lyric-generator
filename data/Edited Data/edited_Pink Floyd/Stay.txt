stay and help me to end the day
and if you dont mind
well break a bottle of wine
stick around and maybe well put one down
'cause i wanna find what lies behind those eyes

midnight blue
burning gold
a yellow moon
is growing cold

i rise, looking through my morning eyes
surprised to find you by my side
rack my brain and try to remember your name
to find the words to tell you good-bye

morning dues
newborn day
midnight blue
turned to gray

midnight blue
burning gold
a yellow moon
is growing cold
