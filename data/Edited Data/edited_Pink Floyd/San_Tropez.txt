as i reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
the sofa in san tropez
breakin a stick with a brick on the sand
ridin a wave in the wake of an old sedan
sleepin alone in the drone of the darkness
scratched by the sand that fell from my love
deep in my dreams and i still hear her callin

if youre alone, ill come ho-ho-home

backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
born in a home with no silver spoon
im drinking champagne like a good tycoon
sooner than wait for a break in the weather
ill gather my far-flung thoughts together
speeding away on the wind to a new day

if youre alone, ill come ho-ho-home

and i pause for a while by a country stile
and listen to the things they say
diggin for gold in a hole in my hand
open a book, take a look at the way things stand
and youre leading me down to the place by the sea
i hear your soft voice calling to me
making a date for later by phone
and if youre alone, ill come ho-ho-home
