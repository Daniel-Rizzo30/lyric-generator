remember a day before today
a day when you were young
free to play alone with time
evening never come

sing a song that cant be sung
without the mornings kiss
queen  you shall be it if you wish
look for your king

why cant we play today?
why cant we stay that way?

climb your favourite apple tree
try to catch the sun
hide from your little brothers gun
dream yourself away

why cant we reach the sun?
why cant we blow the years away?
blow away
blow away
remember
remember
remember
