its awfully considerate of you to think of me here
and im most obliged to you for making it clear that im not here
and i never knew the moon could be so big
and i never knew the moon could be so blue
and im grateful that you threw away my old shoes
and brought me here instead dressed in red
and im wondering who could be writing this song

i dont care if the sun dont shine
and i dont care if nothing is mine
and i dont care if im nervous with you
ill do my loving in the winter

and the sea isnt green
and i love the queen
and what exactly is a dream?
and what exactly is a joke
