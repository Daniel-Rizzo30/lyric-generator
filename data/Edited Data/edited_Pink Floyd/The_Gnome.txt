i want to tell you a story
bout' a little man, if i can
a gnome named grimble grumble
and little gnomes stay in their homes
eating, sleeping
drinking their wine

he wore a scarlet tunic
a blue green hood, it looked quite good
he had a big adventure
amidst the grass, fresh air at last
wining, dining
biding his time

and then one day
hooray!
another way for gnomes to say
ooooooh my

look at the sky, look at the river
isnt it good?
look at the sky, look at the river
isnt it good?
winding, finding places to go
and then one day  hooray!
another way for gnomes to say
ooooooh my
ooooooh my
