take all your overgrown infants away somewhere
and build them a home, a little place of their own
the fletcher memorial home
for incurable tyrants and kings

and they can appear to themselves every day
on closed circuit t.v
to make sure theyre still real
its the only connection they feel

ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, reagan and haig
mr. begin and friend, mrs. thatcher, and paisley
hello maggie!
mr. brezhnev and party
scusi dov√® il bar?
the ghost of mccarthy,
the memories of nixon.
whos the bald chap?
and now, adding colour
a group of anonymous latin-american meat packing glitterati

did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
they can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
and amuse themselves playing games for awhile
boom boom, bang bang, lie down youre dead

safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
with their favourite toys
theyll be good girls and boys
in the fletcher memorial home for colonial
wasters of life and limb
is everyone in?
are you having a nice time?
(goodbye!)
now the final solution can be applied
