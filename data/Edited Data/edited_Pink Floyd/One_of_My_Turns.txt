"oh my god! what a fabulous room! are all these your guitars?"
("i'm sorry sir, i didn't mean to startle you")
"god! this place is bigger than our apartment!"
("let me know when you're entering a room")
("yes, sir")
"um, can i get a drink of water?"
("i was wondering about")
"you want some, huh?"
("yes")
"oh wow! hey, look at this tub! wanna take a bath?"
("i'll have to find out from mrs. bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main")
"what are you watching?"
("if you'll just let me know as soon as you can, mrs. bancroft... mrs. bancroft")
"hello?"
("i don't understand")
"are you feeling okay?"
day after day, the love turns gray
like the skin of the dying man
and night after night, we pretend it's all right
but i have grown older, and you have grown colder
and nothing is very much fun any more
and i can feel one of my turns coming on
i feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
dry as a funeral drum
run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favourite axe
don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
one of my bad days
would you like to watch tv? or get between the sheets?
or contemplate the silent freeway?
would you like something to eat? would you like to learn to fly?
would ya? would you like to see me try?
ah, no!

would you like to call the cops?
do you think it's time i stopped?
why are you running away
