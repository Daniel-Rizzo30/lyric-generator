remember when you were young?
you shone like the sun
shine on you crazy diamond!
now there's a look in your eyes
like black holes in the sky
shine on you crazy diamond!

you were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
blown on the steel breeze
come on, you target for faraway laughter
come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

you reached for the secret too soon
you cried for the moon
shine on you crazy diamond!
threatened by shadows at night
and exposed in the light
shine on you crazy diamond!

well you wore out your welcome with random precision
rode on the steel breeze
come on you raver, you seer of visions
come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!
nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
shine on you crazy diamond
pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
shine on you crazy diamond
and we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, and sail on the steel breeze
come on you boy child, you winner and loser
come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine
