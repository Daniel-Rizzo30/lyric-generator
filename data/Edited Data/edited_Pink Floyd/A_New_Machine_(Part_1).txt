i have always been here
i have always looked out from behind these eyes
it feels like more than a lifetime
feels like more than a lifetime

sometimes i get tired of the waiting
sometimes i get tired of being in here
is this the way that it's always been?
could it ever have been different?

do you ever get tired of the waiting?
do you ever get tired of being in there?
don't worry, nobody lives forever
nobody lives forever
