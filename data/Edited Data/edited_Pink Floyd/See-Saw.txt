marigolds are very much in love
but he doesnt mind
picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land
all the way
she smiles

she goes up while he goes down, down

sits on a stick in the river
laughter in his sleep
sisters throwing stones, hoping for a hit
he doesnt know so then

she goes up while he goes down, down

another time (ah-ah)
another day (ah-ah)
a brothers way to leave (ahhh-ah)
another time (ah-ah)
another day (ah-ah)
shell be selling plastic flowers
on a sunday afternoon
picking up weeds, she hasnt got the time to care
all can see
hes not there

she grows up for another man, and hes down

another time (ah-ah)
another day (ah-ah)
a brothers way to leave (ahhh-ah)
another time (ah-ah)
another day

another time (ah-ah)
another day (ah-ah)
a brothers way to leave (ahhh-ah)
(ahhh-ah, ahhh-ah
