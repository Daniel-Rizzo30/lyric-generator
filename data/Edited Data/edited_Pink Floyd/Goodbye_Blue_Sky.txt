look, mummy!
there's an airplane up in the sky
ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
did-did-did-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
the flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on

goodbye, blue sky
goodbye, blue sky
goodbye
goodbye
