us (us, us, us, us, us) and them (them, them, them, them)
and after all we're only ordinary men
me (me, me, me, me, me) and you (you, you, you, you, you)
god only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"forward" he cried from the rear
and the front rank died
the general sat and the lines on the map
moved from side to side

black (black, black, black, black) and blue (blue, blue, blue, blue)
and who knows which is which and who is who
up (up, up, up, up, up) and down (down, down, down, down)
and in the end it's only round and round, and round
"haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
the poster bearer cried
"listen, son," said the man with the gun
"there's room for you inside"

i mean, they're not gonna kill ya
so like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
they won't do it again
dig it? i mean he got off lightly
'cause i would've given him a thrashing
i only hit him once!
it was only a difference of opinion
but really, i mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

down (down, down, down, down) and out (out, out, out, out)
it can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
with (with, with, with, with), without
and who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
out of the way, it's a busy day
i've got things on my mind
for want of the price of tea and a slice
the old man died
