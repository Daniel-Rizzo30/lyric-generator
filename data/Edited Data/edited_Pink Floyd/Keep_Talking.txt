for millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
we learned to talk

theres a silence surrounding me
i cant seem to think straight
ill sit in the corner
and no one can bother me
i think i should speak now (why wont you talk to me?)
i cant seem to speak now (you never talk to me)
my words wont come out right (what are you thinking?)
i feel like im drowning (what are you feeling?)
im feeling weak now (why wont you talk to me?)
but i cant show my weakness (you never talk to me)
i sometimes wonder (what are you thinking?)
where do we go from here (what are you feeling?)

it doesnt have to be like this
all we need to do is make sure we keep talking


(why wont you talk to me?) i feel like im drowning
(you never talk to me) you know i cant breathe now
(what are you thinking?) were going nowhere
(what are you feeling?) were going nowhere
(why wont you talk to me?)
(you never talk to me)
(what are you thinking?)
(where do we go from here?)
it doesnt have to be like this
all we need to do is make sure we keep talking
