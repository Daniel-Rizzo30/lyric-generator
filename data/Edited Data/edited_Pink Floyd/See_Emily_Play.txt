emily tries but misunderstands (ah, ooh)
she's often inclined to borrow somebodys dreams 'til tomorrow

there is no other day

youll lose your mind and play
free games for may
see emily play

soon after dark, emily cries (ah, ooh)
gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

there is no other day
let's try it another way
youll lose your mind and play
free games for may
see emily play

put on a gown that touches the ground (ah, ooh)
float on a river forever and ever, emily (emily)
there is no other day
let's try it another way
youll lose your mind and play
