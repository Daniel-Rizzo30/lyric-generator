money, get away
you get a good job with more pay and you're okay
money, it's a gas
grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
new car, caviar, four-star daydream
think i'll buy me a football team

money, get back
i'm alright, jack, keep your hands off of my stack
money, it's a hit
ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
i'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
and i think i need a learjet



money, it's a crime
share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
money, so they say
is the root of all evil today

that they're giving none away
away, away, away
away, away, away
