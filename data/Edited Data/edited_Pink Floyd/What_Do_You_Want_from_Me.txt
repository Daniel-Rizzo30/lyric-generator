as you look around this room tonight
settle in your seat and dim the lights
do you want my blood, do you want my tears?
what do you want?
(what do you want from me?)
should i sing until i cant sing anymore?
play these strings until my fingers are raw

you're so hard to please
what do you want from me?

do you think that i know something you dont know?
(what do you want from me?)
if i dont promise you the answers would you go?
(what do you want from me?)
should i stand out in the rain?
do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?

im not the one you need
what do you want from me?

you can have anything you want
you can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
anything you want
you can own everything you see
sell your soul for complete control
is that really what you need?
you can lose yourself this night
see inside, there is nothing to hide
turn and face the light
what do you want from me
