when i get up i've dreamt too long
everything else is half as strong
i could see though, outside my head
they got it right, i got it wrong

i've let too much of it slide through my fingers
fear that has fouled all the love i could bring her

shook off her optimistic hand
i am too fixed on what i've planned
who is the one who can't let go?
i will miss out, hell, don't i know

i've let too much of it slide through my fingers
fear that has fouled all the love i could bring her
(all the love i could bring her)

i've let too much of it slide through my fingers
fear that has fouled all the love i could bring her
i've let too much of it slide through my fingers
fear that has fouled all the songs i could sing her
i've let too much of it slide through my fingers
