i've never known a girl like you before
now, just like in a song from days of yore
'cause here you come a-knocking, knocking on my door
and i've never met a girl like you before


give me just a taste so i want more
now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
and i've never known a girl like you before



and i've never known a girl like you before
never, never, never, never
never known a girl like you before

this old town's changed so much
don't feel like i belong
too many protest singers
not enough protest songs
and now you've come along
yes, you've come along
and i've never met a girl like you before
