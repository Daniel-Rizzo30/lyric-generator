hello, hello, hello, hello
check, check, check

soothing repeat
i look down at my feet
it's a hypnotist's arm
and it works like a charm
but i won't be deprived
real world, surreal life
once inside, there is time
go to sleep, you'll be fine
in the mornin' you'll find
real life was such a grind
off i go, day is done
where a new one's just begun
