i wanted her, i wanted her
but she doesn't like the life that i lead
she doesn't like the life that i lead
doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
or sittin' around smokin' weed
i must seem more like a friend in need
and i boast that it is meant to be

but, in all honesty, i don't have a hope in hell
i'm happy just to watch her move
and in all honesty, i don't have a hope in hell
i'm happy just to watch her move

and she doesn't like the friends that i make
doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
she just gets bored sitting by the lake
her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
and i boast that it is meant to be

but, in all honesty, i don't have a hope in hell
i'm happy just to watch her move

but, in all honesty, he didn't have a hope in hell
now we'll never see him move
