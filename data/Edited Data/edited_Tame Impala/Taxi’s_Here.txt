i was trying to resolve and im waiting
it felt natural
oh, i was hoping it would come out right
who was i kidding

push the button and start counting down
oh, time is crawling to the moment
beyond which
i can choose
i can fall
i can lose
control
i concur
with the doubt
but i cant
turn back round
and they trip
whats beyond
but time
is rolling on
rolling on

now lets do this right
everybody
(and ill be trying)
it wont come out right
i can fold
i can lose
control
i can lose
control
i can face
the unknown
yes, i must
venture there
if i fail
i dont care

(now lets do this right)
theres so much
left unclear
but its time
taxis here
