how you gonna let me know?
when the moment comes to show you
what we like to talk about
listen to me, (?) just where
i know

where youll be

just when i might come on running
just when i might come around
i know you wont be wondering where ive been half the time
no word of reassurances from the other side
so i wonder if i did it right
