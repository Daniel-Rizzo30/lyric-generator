i was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
which is standard for me, thursday, :
i've got a pretty solid routine these days
i don't know, it just works for me
anyway, i was leaving, i was getting in my car
and i went to adjust the rear-view mirror
but, in its reflection, just for a second
i saw a figure, started to trigger
memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
who was that? it was my lover
a lover from a past life

from a past life
feel like i saw a ghost
from a past life
so unexpected
from a past life
i was transfixed
from a past life

from a past life
crazy
from a past life
it takes a lot to trip me out
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)
for the first time
in a long time
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)


from a past life
i guess there's no harm in trying
from a past life
what's the worst that could happen?
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)
for the first time
in a long time
(i tried to say it but it never came out right)
past life
from a past life
(you're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
for the first time
(i know it's late, it just didn't feel right)
in a long time
