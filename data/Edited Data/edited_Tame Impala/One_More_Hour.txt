just a moment
right before all the song and dance
wasn't brave enough to tell you
but thereain'tgonna be anotherchance
it's not long until (all thati have)
and everything's still (one more hour)
minutes are racing, whatever i've done
i did it for love (all that i have)
i did it for fun (one more hour)
couldn't get enough (all that i have)
i did it for fame (one more hour)
but never for money
not for houses, not for her
not for my future children
until now

how could i love again?
how could i ever ask for more?
and to the road ahead
into a life i can't ignore
(lose her) how could i love again?
(move on) how can i walk this path for sure?
(lose her) with no more time to spare
(move on) i know the answer more and more
as long as i can, long as i can
spend some time alone
as long as i can, long as i can
be the man i am

ooh, life is strange
for one more hour
i can rage
for one more hour

as long as i can (lose her), as long as i can (move on)
spend some time alone
as long as i can (lose her), as long as i can (move on)
remember who i am
as long as i can (lose her), as long as i can (move on)
spend some time alone
as long as i can (how could i love again?), as long as i can
be the man i am
