you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

said you wouldn't be home late tonight
i gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
now my only company's a half full glass of wine

thank god i've been blessed with a patient mind
because what i want to happen won't happen in a very long time
now my only company's a half full glass of wine

you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
you leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
