like the brutal autumn sun
it dawns on me, what have i done?
saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
but it buys me a little more time
lost in the moment for the second time
each fucking doubt i make unleash a cry
i'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
in desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

'cause i'm a man, woman
don't always think before i do
'cause i'm a man, woman
the only answer i've got for you
'cause i'm a man, woman
not often proud of what i choose
i'm a human, woman
a greater force that i answer to

once again, as it takes a hold
i am aware i'm not in control
i have a conscience that is nеver fooled
but it's prone to bе overruled
you wanna know why i always think i'm right?
you never accept defeat and let it slide
i have no voice if i don't speak my mind
my weakness is the source of all my pride
and i'll tell you why
'cause i'm a man, woman
don't always think before i do
'cause i'm a man, woman
the only answer i've got for you
'cause i'm a man, woman
not often proud of what i choose
i'm a human, woman
a greater force that i answer to
