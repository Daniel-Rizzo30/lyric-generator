i was raging, it was late
in the world my demons cultivate
i felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
yes, i'm changing, yes, i'm gone
yes, i'm older, yes, i'm moving on
and if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
life is moving, can't you see
there's no future left for you and me
i was hoping and i was searching endlessly
but baby, now there's nothing left that i can do

so don't be blue
there is another future
waiting there for you

i saw it different, i must admit
i caught a glimpse, i'm going after it
they say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
yes, i'm changing, can't stop it now
and even if i wanted i wouldn't know how
another version of myself i think i've found at last
and i can't always hide away
curse indulgence and despise the fame
there is a world out there and it's calling my name
and it's calling yours, girl
