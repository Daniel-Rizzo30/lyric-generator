i know where you went, but i don't know how you got there
i know where you went, but i don't know how you got there
silver tongue hill, where you talk up what i'd play down
i would speak up, but i wouldn't know what to say
oh, to say

lucidity, come back to me
put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
oh, it's hard to tell, breaks down
there is a will, there is a way

wandering around like spare time never knew it
i might suck, fizzle or i might just float away
(float away)

and we'll go running off tonight
high above, where we won't even
need to reach the sky, my love
oh, there will be a change in the air
nobody will be anybody else

lucidity, come back to me
put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
oh, where we'll go, tiptoe
tread boldly right down to the lair
