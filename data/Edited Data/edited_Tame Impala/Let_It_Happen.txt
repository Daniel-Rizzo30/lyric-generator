it's always around me, all this noise
but not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"let it happen, let it happen (it's gonna feel so good)
just let it happen, let it happen"

all this running around trying to cover my shadow
a notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
all this running around bearing down on my shoulders
i can hear an alarm, must be morning

i heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
it's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
and when it happens, when it happens (i won't be holding on)
so let it happen, let it happen

all this running around, i can't fight it much longer
something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
if my take off fails, make up some other story
but if i never come back, tell my mother i'm sorry
i will not vanish and you will not scare me
tryna get through it, try to bounce to it
you were not thinkin' that i will not do it
they be lovin' someone and im not that stupid
take the next ticket to take the next train
why would i do it? and you wanna think that
