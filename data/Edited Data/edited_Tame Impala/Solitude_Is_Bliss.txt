cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
i care less and less about it and less about you
no one else around to look at me
so i can look at my shadow as much as i please


oh, you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel

space around me where my soul can breathe
i've got body that my mind can leave
nothing else matters, i don't care what i miss
company's okay, solitude is bliss


and you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel
movement doesn't flow
quite like it does when i'm alone
i'll be the one who's free
you and all your friends can watch me
today
(don't ask me how you're supposed to feel)

you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel
