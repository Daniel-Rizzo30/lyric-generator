now i gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
now i gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
now i gotta tell 'em i don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
it was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much i've been wrong about
and i don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one i can't live without
so i'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
to try and for-

and as the years go by
your name will fade out gradually
they'll think my heart went dry
but it was waiting in-

so now i gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
it could've been magic, nearly had ya, can you imagine? nearly had ya
'til it becomes another one of the things that i just can't talk about
i'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
try and for-

and as the years go by
your name will fade out gradually
they'll think my heart went dry
but it was waiting in the wings
and as the years go by
you'll stay a banished memory
they'll say my love has died
but it was waiting in the wings
