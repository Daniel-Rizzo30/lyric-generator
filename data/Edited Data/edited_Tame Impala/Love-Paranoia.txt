i may not be as honest as i ought to be
now that, when the walls go up
i said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
babe, to know, i could just be paranoid
won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
"does it really fucking matter, babe?" is all you can ask me
okay, fair play, here we go

i've heard those words before
are you sure it was nothing
cause it made me feel like dying inside
never thought i was insecure, but it's pure
didn't notice until i was in love for real
am i really gonna cross the line
just to find what you're typing?
if only i could read your mind
ooh, i'd be fine, i'd be normal
nows my time, gonna do it

and suddenly i'm the phony one
the only one with a problem
true love is bringing it out of me
the worst in me, and i know now
do you remember the time we were
the time we were by the ocean?
i didn't care if it was day or night
the world was right where i wanted
girl, i'm sorry
babe, i'm really, really sorry
