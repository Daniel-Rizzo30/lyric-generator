in the end, it's stronger than i know how to be
and i can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
i fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
i don't want our footsteps to be silent anymore


in the end its coming, theres nothing left to do
but i'm still not certain, just how i'm gonna feel


it's getting closer
it's getting closer
it's getting closer
(i'm not ready)
it's getting closer
(i need a little more time)
