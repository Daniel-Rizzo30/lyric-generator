'cause i was still unsure
but it's something i'm used to
and i could tell by your face
no one's ever been rude to you
but i could tell you things
that i can't say to anyone
and you came 'round today
but you didn't stay very long

now it's like the world owes you
walking around like everybody should know you
i wanna be like we used to
but now you're worried whose audience will lose you

and i had no idea
what that feeling could do to you
and i could tell you've changed
by the people around you
i used to take the long way
just so i could walk past your door
i used to wait outside
but i guess i won't anymore
