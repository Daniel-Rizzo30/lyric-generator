save your fragile mama's heart
and while she will come for you
but i wander

and i wonder just how far will you need to be
for shaking talk so easily
for hours on end, i wander
still i don't even know her

feel just like i need to be
back where i was before
i couldn't go back
but i wander

and i wonder just how far will you need to be
for shaking talk so easily
for hours on end, i wander
still i don't even know


how it keeps a lid on me
how it keeps a lid on me (how)
how it keeps a lid on me
how it keeps a lid on me (how)

and i wonder
just how far will you need to be
for shaking tough so easily
for hours on end, i wander
(ooh)
