thank you guys
hey, uh, give it up for white denim
holy moly, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good musicians
they make us look like novices
alright
let's see if we can prove our musical prowess
on this song, called "half a glass of wine"
go crazy, chicago

said you wouldn't be home late tonight
i gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
now my only company's a half full glass of wine


it's been so long
since i've held your hand
you don't know how hard it can be

thank god that i've been blessed with a patient mind
cause' what i want to happen won't happen for a very long time
now my only company's a half full glass of wine

it's been so long
since i've held your hand
you don't know how hard it can be
you don't know how hard it can be
