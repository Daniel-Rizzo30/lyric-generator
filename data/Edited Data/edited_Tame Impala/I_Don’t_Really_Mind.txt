shifting, shifting, shifting a lot
like it makes so much difference to me
huffing, puffing, marching around
like i know how much better it should be
i know it looks like i disagree, nine-tenths of the time

but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind

childhood puppy is old and gruff
your mother wants to give him away
pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed
three weeks ago today

but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind

but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
but i don't really mind
