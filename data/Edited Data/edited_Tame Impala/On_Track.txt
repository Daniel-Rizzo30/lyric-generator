i close my front door and turn on the light
i let out a breath andholdin a sigh
ain'tnothin' new, ain't that much insight
and if i'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like

but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
strictly speaking, i'm holding on
more than a minor setback
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
and all of my dreams are still in sight
'cause strictly speaking, i've got my whole life
i lost a wheel a while back
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
challenges falling in my lap
strung out again, but still on track

i know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
i know i tried before this, i know it's nearly august
i know i can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
sayin', "babe, i just adore this" and, "babe, can we afford this?"
i know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here
i didn't really go for it, so not a lot to show for it

('cause life's like that)
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
strictly speaking, i'm holding back
troubles keep falling in my lap
yeah, but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
so tell everyone i'll be alright
'cause strictly speaking, i've got my whole life
more than one major setback
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track (yeah)
