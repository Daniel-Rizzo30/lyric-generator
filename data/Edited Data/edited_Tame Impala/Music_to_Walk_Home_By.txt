but that's only while i think of you (think of you, think of you)
some vision that i hold on to (hold on to, hold on to)
you know it's everything i do (thing i do, thing i do)
you know it's everything i do (thing i do)
can almost stand competing with the others
can almost hear the fun that i should be having
instead of just dreaming
but it's only when i think of you
the mover i could turn into
there must be something i can do
yeah, there must be something i can do

i just don't know how to feel right
a beautiful girl is wasting my life
i'm playing a part as somebody else
while tryin' so hard to be myself
i just need to hear somebody say
this will all make sense one day
i guess i'm alright, but they're all doing so well
what i wouldn't give to be under that spell

but you don't know the truth
i'm in love with you
you just don't believe
in anything i do

in so many ways i'm somebody else
while tryin' so hard to be myself
i just need to hear somebody say
this will all make sense one day
well, it's getting late i'd better go
i made it this far as far as i know
