said the voice from afar
"don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
waiting for everyone else around to agree
might take too long
might take too long"


that you are all you're meant to be
when the one from my dream
is sitting right next to me
and i don't know what to do
oh, alter ego

get them to love you, while they may
depending on your words and wealth
the only one who's really judging you is yourself
nobody else
nobody else

if i could part

that you are all you're meant to be
when the one from my dream
is sitting right next to me
and i don't know what to do
oh, alter ego
