send me back, the feeling's reached the core
ocean waves sound more like whispers from the shore

see my eyes look back again once before
see my eyes look back again once before

there is no
there's nothing that i need to say

see my eyes look back again once before
see my eyes look back again once before
once before

see my eyes look back again once before
see my eyes look back again once before
see my eyes look back again once before
(once before)
see my eyes look back again once before

feeling's in the core
feeling's in the

feeling's in the core
