if only there could be another way to do this
'cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
i know i always said that i could never hurt you
well, this is the very, very last time i'm ever going to

but i know that i'll be happier
and i know you will, too
said i know that i'll be happier
and i know you will, too
eventually, ah
eventually, ah

wish i could turn you back into a stranger
'cause if i was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change it

but i know that i'll be happier
and i know you will, too
said i know that i'll be happier
and i know you will, too
eventually, ah
eventually, ah
and i know just what i've got to do
and it's got to be soon
'cause i know that i'll be happier
and i know you will, too

eventually
eventually
eventually
eventually
eventually
eventually
eventually
eventually
