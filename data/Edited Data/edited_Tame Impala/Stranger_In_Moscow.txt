i was wandering in the rain (mask of life, feelin' insane)
swift and sudden fall from grace (sunny days seem far away)
kremlin's shadow belittlin' me (stalin's tomb won't let me be)
on and on and on it came

how does it feel? (how does it feel?)
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?

how does it feel? (how does it feel?)
how does it feel?
how does it feel
when you're alone
and you're cold inside?

here abandoned in my fame (armageddon of the brain)
kgb was doggin' me (take my name and just let me be)
then a begger boy called my name (happy days will drown the pain)
on and on and on it came

how does it feel? (how does it feel?)
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?

like a stranger in moscow
like a stranger in moscow
like a stranger in moscow

how does it feel? (how does it feel?)
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
