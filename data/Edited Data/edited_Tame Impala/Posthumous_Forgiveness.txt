ever since i was a small boy
no one else compared to you, no way
i alwaysthoughtheroes stayed close
whenevertroubled times arose
i didn't know
ain't alwayshow it goes

every single word you told me
i believed without a question, always
to save all of us, you told us both to trust
but now i know you only saved yourself

did you think i'd never know?
never wise up as i grow?


and you could store an ocean in the holes
in any of the explanations that you gave
and while you still had time, you had a chance
but you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave
did you think i'd never know?
never wise up as i grow?
did you hope i'd never doubt?
never one day work it out?


you were runnin' for cover
doin' like any other
fallin' out with a lover
you didn't know that i suffered
what a thing to discover
if there was time to recover
one-on-one with each other
just a boy and a father
what i'd give for another
everything that i have
wouldn't need this for long
never speak of the time
that you left us alone
me and steve on our own

(this time) wanna tell you 'bout the time
(i know) i was in abbey road
or the time that i had
mick jagger on the phone
i thought of you when we spoke


(this time) i wanna say, "it's all right"
(i know) you're just a man after all
and i know you had demons
i got some of my own
i think you passed them along
