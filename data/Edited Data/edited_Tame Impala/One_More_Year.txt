do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
our minds were racing and timewentslow
if there wastrouble in the world, we didn'tknow
if we had a care, it didn't show
but now i worry our horizon's been nothing new
'cause i get this feeling and maybe you get it too
we're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'cause what we did one day on a whim
has slowly become all we do

i never wanted any other way to spend our lives
i know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
and now i fear we might
ooh, now i fear we might

we got a whole year (one more year)
fifty-two weeks
seven days each
(one more year) four seasons, one reason, one way
one year (one more year), one year
one year, from today
from today
