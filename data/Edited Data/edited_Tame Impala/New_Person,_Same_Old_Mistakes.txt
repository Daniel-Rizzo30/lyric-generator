i can just hear them now
"how could you let us down?"
but they don't know what i found
or see it from this way 'round
feeling it overtake
all that i used to hate
one by one, every trait
i tried, but it's way too late
all the signs i don't read
two sides of me can't agree
will i be in too deep?
going with what i always longed for

feel like a brand new person
(but you'll make the same old mistakes)
i don't care, i'm in love
(stop before it's too late)
(i know) feel like a brand new person
(but you'll make the same old mistakes)
i finally know what it's like (you don't have what it takes)
(stop before it's too late)
(i know there's too much at stake)
(making the same mistakes)
and i still don't know why it's happening
(stop while it's not too late)
and i still don't know
finally taking flight
i know you don't think it's right
i know that you think it's fake
maybe fake's what i like
the point is, i have the right
not thinking in black and white
i'm thinking it's worth the fight
soon to be out of sight
knowing it all this time
going with what i always longed for

feel like a brand new person
(but you'll make the same old mistakes)
i don't care, i'm in love
(stop before it's too late)
feel like a brand new person
(but you'll make the same old mistakes)
so how do i know i've gone too far? (you don't have what it takes)
(stop before it's too late)

man, i know that it's hard to digest
but maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
and i know that it's hard to digest
a realisation is as good as a guess
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
