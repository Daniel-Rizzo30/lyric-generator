has it really been that long?
did i count the days wrong?
did we just go 'round and 'round
all the way to step one?


just growin' up in stages
(lay down, low down)
livin' life in phases
another season changes
and still, my days are shapeless


i'm just laying here
waiting for a change to come
take us to the place
takin' us where we would have gone

i'm just growin' up in stages
(lay down, low down)
livin' life in phases
another season changes
and still, my ways are aimless, i know
we're growin' up in stages
and i'm runnin' out of patience
growin' up
