there's no use trying to relate to that older soul
and no use trying to debatethatthey've got itwrong
there's no use pining for lovewhen you're on your own
and no use crying outside if nobody's home
there's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
so why do i go wrong on repeat?


what do you want when i say i won't?
and though i try, i do the same, as though i must
and in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

there's no use trying to relate to that older soul
and no use biding your time if the bell is tolled

sympathy for the fauna
fragile life in the sauna
in the sea getting warmer
endlessly 'round the corner

and though i try, i do the same, as though i must
and in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
