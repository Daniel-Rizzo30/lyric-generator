like the brutal morning sun
it dawns on me, what have i done?
saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
but it buys me a little more time
lost in the moment for the second time
each fuck up that i make, it makes you cry
i'm as pathetic, as the reason why
in desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

cause i'm a man, woman
don't always think before i do
cause i'm a man, woman
that's the only answer i've got for you (uh)
cause i'm a man, woman
not often proud of what i choose
i'm a human, woman
a greater force i answer to

once again, as it takes a hold
i am aware i'm not in control
you see, i have a conscience and it's never fooled
but it's prone to be overruled
you wanna know why i always think im right?
(why?) you never accept defeat and let it slide
(why?) i have no voice if i dont speak my mind
(why?) my weakness is the source of all my pride
i'll tell you why
cause i'm a man, woman
don't always think before i do
cause i'm a man, woman
that's the only answer i've got for you (uh)
cause i'm a man, woman
i'll never be as strong as you
i'm a human, human
a greater force i answer to (uh
