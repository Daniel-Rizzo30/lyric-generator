feel it come
i, i don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
woah, i'll let desire be, desire go
oh, dare i face the real world?

every day, back and forth, what's it for?
what's it for? back and forth, every day
every day, back and forth, what's it for?
i don't know, i'll get out
won't have to check my watch

i, i don't have the verve to be-elong to this dead side
woah-oah, why i ever tried, i, i don't know
oh, dare i face the real world?

every day, back and forth, what's it for?
what's it for? back and forth, every day
every day, back and forth, what's it for?
i don't know, i forget
try to let desire be, desire go

we can keep on walking
you can get to know me
if you just let it happen
i wont tell anybody
feel, feel it come, feel it come
i..
feel it come
i, i don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
woah, i'll let desire be, desire go
