tryin' to get control
pressure's takin' its toll
stuck in the middle zone
i just want you alone
myguessinggame is strong
waytoo real to be wrong
caught upin your show
but at least now i know

it wasn't love,itwasn'tlove
it must havebeen an illusion
mistakenfor love, it wasn't love
it must have been a confusion

my guessing game is strong
now that i know what's on
high like amphetamine
maybe it's just a dream
that's what it means to crush
now that i'm waking up
i still feel the blow
but at least now i know
it wasn't love, it wasn't love
it must have been an illusion
mistaken for love, it wasn't love
it must have been a confusion
it wasn't love, it wasn't love
it must have been an illusion
mistaken for love, it wasn't love
it must have been a confusion
it must have been an illusion
it must have been a confusion
