everything you ever told me could have been a lie
we may never have been in love
stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
or a hit from above
or a hit from above
i don't need what i'm holding
what i'm holding on, i wish i didn't know


fluctuations are aching my soul
expectation is taking its toll
expectation is taking its toll
'cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
we may never have been in love

and then i would escape
i'll never, ever have to see another disappointed face
no one to please
every now and then, it feels like
in all of the universe, there is nobody for me
i told myself i wouldn't care, no i wouldn't care
but when she said she'd come 'round
i combed my hair, yes, i checked my hair

fluctuations are aching my soul
expectation is taking its toll
fluctuations are aching my soul
expectation is taking its toll
fluctuation does make me feel old
expectation is taking its toll
fluctuations are aching my soul
expectation is taking its toll
fluctuations are aching my soul
