i'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
no destiny is too far
we can getahome in miami,go and get married
tattoo your nameon my arm

this traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
yes, reminiscent, i think this is different
i know this is different (i'm about to)
let's cause something permanent
just so we know we can

i'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
no destiny is too far
did you say, "and here comes forever"?
oh, here forever, let go of me with open arms

we'll be lovers until the end of time (i'm about to)
i see it now
i see just how you're so right (i'm about to)
you're so clear now
i'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
no destiny is too far
we can get a home in miami, go and get married
tattoo your name on my arm
