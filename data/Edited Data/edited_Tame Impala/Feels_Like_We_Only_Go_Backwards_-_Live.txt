it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling

i know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
but i hear it inside my head all day
when i realize i'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
your feelings don't show

it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling

the seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'cause i decided long ago
but that's the way it seems to go
when trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

it feels like i only go backwards, darling
every part of me says, "go ahead"
but i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling
it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
but i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling
it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
but i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling
