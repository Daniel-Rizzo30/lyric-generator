but don't remind me of home
there's everywhere i'd rather go
it's true that some things have to change
oh no

and don't remind me of home
or i might notice where i am
it's true that some things
have to change
i know some things have to change
it's true that some things have to change
i know some things have to change
oh no

i'm gazing out the window
as i ascend into the sky
but i'm the one who's left behind
i'm the one who's left behind
there is nothing that is safe
i know some things have to change
oh yeah, i do
yeah, i do
but don't remind me of home
in case it isn't quite the same
