nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you i don't know
maybe i'm just reading into it a little deeper than i should
we would make it easy, we would take it slowly, if only we could


elodie, look at me, unless you're tryin' to hurt me
heavy blow, down i go, now i just want to let go
is it right? is it wrong? i don't know
it's not the cause i'm fightin' for anymore, it sucks to keep on runnin'
eventually, there will be a time for clearer thinking
for now, i weep, can't get to sleep, i try to hold a good feeling
i just get one, here it comes, there it goes
now we just might lose the fight, yeah, but it's alright, it wasn't our decision

nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you what i know
every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
i'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then i'll let you know
