all those things i ever, thought would never end
to think theyre now all memories, sends me 'round the bend
to watch her airplane swaying, coming in to land
there, my world is hanging, in someone else's hands
and if i have done something, and you have to let me go
think of me as someone, someone that you know
but if i don't hear something, pretty soon from now
i'll disconnect completely, see how that works out

i wasn't, daring, not much a chancer
oh, my darling, why won't you answer?
: a.m, midnight in dover
sun's coming up now, i guess it's over
playing his guitar, while hes dying of cancer
oh, my father, why wont you answer?
: a.m, midnight in dover
sun's coming up now, i guess it's over
