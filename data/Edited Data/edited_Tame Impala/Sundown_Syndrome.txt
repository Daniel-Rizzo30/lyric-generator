please don't get answers from eyes
you know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
just let the spare moment flow
rounding steps as i go through the open doors

please don't deflate from a sigh
i'd hold still every time but i'd start to shake
i wander around for days
wondering what i'll say when they want the truth

you will never know how hard i try
to keep from waning while waiting at the start
the depth of every touch is real as you need
but words don't do any favours for me
oh...
