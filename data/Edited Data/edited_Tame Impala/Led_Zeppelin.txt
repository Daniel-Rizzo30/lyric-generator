senses taking over
thought you set me free
i've tried to get up
but it was pouring down on me
keeps on burnin' deeper
desperate for you to be
seven psychiatrists couldn't drag it out of me

ooh, this is what i need
ooh, tell me you're allowed to let it show

just like it was magic
i was far enough to see
better than to get just what
a stranger did to me
is it 'cause i lie?
is it 'cause i don't?
well, i just don't know
keep on asking me
darling, let me see (keep on asking)
i'd give anything to let it go
