thought of something in the moonlight
what do you think it was?

thought of something in the moonlight
forgot it by the morning sun

whispering the sweeter nothings, feel you high above. now i'm your love

tell me why you think i love you, and i'll tell you if your right. told you all my darkest secret, but i think i lied

whispering the sweeter nothings, feel you high above. now i'm your love

will i ever find your love? tell me before the break of day
i was passing down your fair, latenight moonlight fades away
latenight moonlight fades away
latenight moonlight fades away
