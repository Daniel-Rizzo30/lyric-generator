come down on me i won't be anyone else
clip time with me, ride with me chasing my thrills
he's leaving me, even you and everyone else
it seems it's getting worse but who can really tell

i'm stepping outside now
i'll leave you behind now
i finally came down
i'm ready to let it all out

how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick
how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick

look down on me but try to be there for me still
doesn't really seem like you're loving yourself
why don't you climb to the top of my hill
and rest up your legs on the stone
i'm stepping outside now
i'll leave you behind now
i finally came down
i'm ready to let it all out

how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick
how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick

never try to lie to me 'cause you will fuck up everything
toss a number in my lottery
you aren't who you try to be, no
never try to lie to me 'cause you will fuck up everything
toss a number in my lottery
you aren't who you try to be at all
never try to lie to me, don't fuck up everything
toss a number in my lottery
you aren't who you wanna be
how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick
how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick

how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick
how did i get here
feels like a lightyear
i should have no fear
yet my hands are slick
