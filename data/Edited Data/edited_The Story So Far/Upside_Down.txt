, staring in your face like its the front of the door
i know right now is hard cause this all feels like a chore
i dont want this as a job help me find something more
i cannot tell the ceiling from the floor
is this really what you want?
swear i never meant to haunt
all i ever do is taunt
couldnt handle how you flaunt
now its quiet on the front
has been for so many months
now its wild to remember i was in love with you once

it's all love now, upside down
it's all love now, upside down

let me go, cut the leash before
i lose us in a bad undertow
have to channel how you made me feel
to play every show
make my snide suggestions about
the things i dont know
i will not catch a feeling ill just float
all that time across the pond
all this resin in my lungs
no more room to shoulder on
am i even having fun?
colins sleeping with his gun
scott is looking for the one
mertz is going by ryan now that weve all had our run
it's all love now, upside down
it's all love now, upside down

carry baggage i can't put down
every show, every night, every town
carry baggage i can't put down
every show, every night, every town

it's all love now, upside down
it's all love now, upside down
it's all love now, upside down
it's all love now, upside down
