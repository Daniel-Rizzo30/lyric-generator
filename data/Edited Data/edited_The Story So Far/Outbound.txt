on an outbound train surrounded by strangers
i wonder just where they'll go
and as the worldfliesby right outsidemy window
i see the birds inthe sky with nowhere else to be
as our train car derails and rolls into the ocean
i'll be honest i wouldn't miss a thing about these
cold-hearted towns and the distance between everyone here
and everything

as the world flies by outside of my window
i'll be honest i wouldn't miss a thing
when compassion is dead
we'll drown ourselves in a sea of paper
that glitters like gold

some say that hate, that it speaks in whispers
but i can hear, but i can hear
some say that hate
(some say that hate), that it speaks in whispers
but i can hear their curdling screams

and as our train car derails and rolls into the ocean
i'll be honest, i'll be honest about everything
about everything
as the world flies by outside of my window
i'll be honest i wouldn't miss a thing
as the world flies by outside of my window
i'll be honest, i'll be honest about everything

(as the world flies by outside of my window)
with the exception of a few familiar faces
this place will, this place will never feel like home
(as the world flies)
so we keep our distance and we learn to say goodbye
(as the world flies by outside of my window)
this place will, this place will never feel like home to me
(as the world flies)
so we keep our distance and we learn to say goodbye
(as the world flies by outside of my window)
this place will, this place will never feel like home to me
(as the world flies by)
so we keep our distance and we learn to say goodbye
(as the world flies by outside of my window)
this place will, this place will never feel like home to me
