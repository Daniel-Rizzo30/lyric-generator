gone now i keep my distance
but still show persistence in trying to find out how you are
its really testing my patience, watching you waste this
life that you have of yours in a bar
and i get the feeling that youre gonna leave him
cause you just cant seem to get off
youre so appealing, you can get anyone that you want somehow

patience is useless when im sober and youre wasted
and you dont wanna hear it, so go on just leave it

calm down, cant we get level?
cant we be civil? we share a lot of things
and yeah, i think back when it was simple
before i had earned some, and all i ever did was sing
been caught under pressure, trying to measure
how i feel bout this whole thing
youre so appealing, you can get anyone that you want somehow

patience is useless when im sober and youre wasted
and you dont wanna hear it so go on just leave it
and i count the times that im driving home
im talking to myself like im not alone
trying to figure to out who ive been running from
gotta figure out who ive been running from
i keep my distance now
forcing my jaw to smile
i keep my distance now
forcing my jaw to smile

patience is useless when im sober and youre wasted
and you dont wanna hear it so go on just leave it
and i count the times that im driving home
im talking to myself like im not alone
trying to figure to out who ive been running from
gotta figure out who ive been running from
