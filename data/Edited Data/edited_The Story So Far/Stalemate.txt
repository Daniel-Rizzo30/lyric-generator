hard to clench my fist well with all of the things i should tell
tension and an ill will towards you and i
its not the same as you feel, it used to be a light teal
but that shade was never real for you and i

cant ignore, wont ignore
that i just dont know you anymore
cant ignore, wont ignore
that which you played me for

cant ignore, wont ignore
that i just dont know you anymore
cant ignore, wont ignore
that which you played me for

you know how hard that i fell
hazy, every detail about who cared the most
when it came to you and i
i never thought that youd bail
i guess i let it go stale
my blood is always hot when it comes to you and i

you want him like you wanted me
but i know that its not the same thing
covet what you cannot bring
i wont calm down
ill never let it be
you want him like you wanted me
but i know that its not the same thing
covet what you cannot bring
i wont calm down
ill never let it be
cant ignore, wont ignore
that i just dont know you anymore
cant ignore, wont ignore
that which you played me for
cant ignore, wont ignore
that i just dont know you anymore
cant ignore, wont ignore
that which you played me for
