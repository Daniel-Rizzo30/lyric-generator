say what you need to say for the last time
state all the premises figuring youll be just fine
so ill get mine you get yours and if were both happy it's settled forevermore
holding the impression of a man when i was still a boy
said no regrets but it's hard not to feel any remorse
im still debating whether i have even found the source
of all my discomfort and blunt discourse

but i know what i want and dont need what i get
i invest my ideas but get swallowed in debt
and the only release is to yell and to sweat
until my clothes are soaking wet
stay under my skin
tear me limb from limb
plague me to an end
i cant believe i always thought i would be there for you
for now ill learn and settle for less
shut my eyes and get some rest
feel the pulse beneath this sunken chest
and maybe one day i can be there for you
isnt it true that if it hadnt been for me youd still have no place safe to fall
and all this time i thought i knew
when i had no idea at all
all is fair in love and war
you have your gifts some say they're poor
but i dont care about any of that anymore
let us depart and return when we have grown some more
i wish i could say that ive seen this before
the depth of the bottom the taste of the floor
it leaves me restless and tired and sore
but you wont break my mind just yet
i battle this alone

i dont want to push you
i just want to grieve
i dont want to push you
i just want to leave
