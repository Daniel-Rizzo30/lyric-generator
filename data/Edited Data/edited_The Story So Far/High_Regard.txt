barter and trade, always passive-aggressive
in spite of who you say you are
smother my name under soil and dirt in the earth
widen the distance apart
fuck an apology, i'm not sorry for anything
i've been holding back my apathy for far too long
you don't deserve what you haven't earned
and your place in my heart has just grown so small

i'd like to think that you're worth my time
but you embody everything that i hate
take a good hard look at what you see
i've lost all my hope and all my faith
'cause when i barely fuck up, you just recoil and weep
what do you want from me? i'm just a kid who got in too deep
my walls are built up high, forever bound to be steep
i've got a birds' eye view of all the secrets you keep

try to tell me that you knew from the start
that i would come to know that most would never enter my heart
because i'm colder than the others, it's what sets me apart
you manipulate and try to shine a light on my dark
but this is my life, you should bounce & never call again
no more strife, go find it in the souls of the other men
you know you're not as smart as you look
i'm gonna take back what you took
you know you're not as smart as you look
i'm going to take back what you took
and you didn't know shit from the start
and you didn't know shit from the start
