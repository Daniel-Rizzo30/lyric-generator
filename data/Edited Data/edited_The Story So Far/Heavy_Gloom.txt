i know all your flaws and most of your fears
i havent been home a lot in the last two years
the constant absence from all my peers
the vibration still steady inside my ears
and i know you hate it, i always restate it
but im still so frustrated 'cause im the one you cheated

it cuts so much deeper
why would i wanna see her?
only had one beer
and i dont wanna sleep here

i hope you feel that heavy gloom
when youre all done up in a crowded room
and your life trips up over those shoes
that you paid too much for but not in dues
and ill be watching from a distance
wouldnt wanna miss this
was it fake the whole time? was it just instance?
man, its so personal, yet its business
i want it to hit so close to home

it cuts so much deeper
why would i wanna see her?
only had one beer
and i dont wanna sleep here
and i know you dont care
youve made it so clear
swore i had no fear
not until you came near
and how much does it cost
to get you back here inside those clubs
that you love so fucking much?
was i too harsh in my lament to you
that i fell so out of touch?
back and forth because i cant understand how you
control all my lust and form the words on my tongue

it cuts so much deeper
why would i wanna see her?
only had one beer
and i dont wanna sleep here
and i know you dont care
youve made it so clear
swore i had no fear
not until you came near
it cuts so much deeper
why would i wanna see her?
only had one beer
and i dont wanna sleep here
and i know you dont care
