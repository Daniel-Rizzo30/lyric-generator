tell me, did you practice what you said to me?
was never there when i was supposed to be
is that supposed to be some kind of joke to me?
leave home, tour hard, then well see

change up your face, attempt to erase
but youll never feel the void in my space
im off, off this bad taste
wasting my time, my time in one place

when you left, you ruined your name for me
i wear a scowl so that they can always see
nowhere near where i wanna be
grinding all my teeth again

change up your face, attempt to erase
but youll never feel the void in my space
im off, off this bad taste
wasting my time, my time in one place

attract to me, come back to me
im waiting on you so patiently
someday soon i hope to see
that youre feeling indigo way down in your soul
its all facade, it has to be
youre planning on it so carefully
let a couple years roll by, bet we come back to this again
change up your face, attempt to erase
but youll never feel the void in my space
im off, off this bad taste
wasting my time, my time in one place
