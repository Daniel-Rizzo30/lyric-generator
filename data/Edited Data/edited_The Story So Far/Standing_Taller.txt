you can take take it back
(can you?)
you prepare your life
(hear my?)
the audience is here
(words?)
can't take it back this time

life is but a song i'm playing
listen to the words i'm singing
songs will never play forever
but the melodies will follow out

can you hear my words?
break down the walls that bury yours
can you hear my words?
they were the last you should have heard

i used to not stand my ground
but i'm standing taller now
i will steer this ship to safety
i've been nostalgic lately
