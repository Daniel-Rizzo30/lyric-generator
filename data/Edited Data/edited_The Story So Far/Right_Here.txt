all i really want is to stay right here right now
theres so much more to talk about
the mind you broke and the price that it costs me now
me now

do you see good intent?
when you read me, youre trying to test me
you dont get my mindset
you only see the where and the when
is that how your times spent?
anticipate then its gone again
it's appeal is the lust for the things you conceal
roll on like the spoke in your wheel
until it breaks and you feel how i feel


when i was gone
i slept by myself
and woke up alone
it feels like a fracture
a split in the bone
no more safe time
for us to be home
leaving this again and when
youre in their backyards
youre not here you cant tie my seams
so pick out those glass shards
they dont belong in your feet
in your feet
head on the wall
tell me why i feel so small
when i dont even care at all
head on the wall
tell me why i feel so small
when i dont even care at all
