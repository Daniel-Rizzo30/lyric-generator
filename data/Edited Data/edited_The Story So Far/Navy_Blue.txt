i bet it hurts to read "permanence"
i used to think on all of this
and how you don't
damn, it's hard to find sustenance
when all i had was love for this
and now you don't
now i just abuse substances
to drown out your accomplishments
however few

all of this frustrates me bad
'cause i can't stay mad
at you or change anything that i had
she told me, "don't think like that
it's really not that bad"
i hope this makes you sad
i hope this makes you sad

if it's something serious then hit me up
but until then, the door is shut
forget my room
and if i had a match for every lie
and every attempt to deny
i'd strike a few
i am the walls, the silent halls
my jacket at your sister's wedding
navy blue
all of this frustrates me bad
'cause i can't stay mad
at you or change anything that i had
she told me, "don't think like that
it's really not that bad"
i hope this makes you sad
i hope this makes you sad
