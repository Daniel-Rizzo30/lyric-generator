overseas while youre back west
sleeping off the restlessness
everything will be fine
just gotta keep my mind on your bed and your bed on my mind
im so sore from sleeping on the floor
i never see your face anymore
(maybe ill come back around)
im so sore from sleeping on the floor
i want what we had before
(you made me come back)

stifled there but you still walk in place
im distant now they say im rude of late
i pass up that sleep as my mind debates
the message i put forth just admit if youre not sure

all theyll know is second best
but it still brings the restlessness
dont think that its fine
i lie because this distance is poison
it fucks with my mind
im so sore, can you give me some more
space to grow what was sewn before
(you made me come back around)
im so sore, stomachs on the floor
i swear i always wake up before
(you made me come back)
cant help but dwell on what youre doing
im much too slow for the pace that youre moving
a piece of us will stay unmoving
but hows it ever going to feel the same again?

stifled there but you still walk in place
im distant now they say im rude of late
i pass up that sleep as my mind debates
the message i put forth just admit if youre not sure
stifled there but you still walk in place
im distant now they say im rude of late
i pass up that sleep as my mind debates
the message i put forth just admit if youre not sure


just admit if youre not sure
stifled
