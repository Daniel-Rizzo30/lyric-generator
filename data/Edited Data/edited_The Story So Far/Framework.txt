i still think on you, the place, the time
and all the solitude
theres nothing i hate more
than pushing you away with my fucked up attitude
ive been counting paces
since the last time we touched faces
its a lot like trading spaces
where im the dormant one and youre away

howd this happen?
found your way in
so distracting
splitting me in half again

cant ever sever the ties i made
the knots are strong
the frameworks laid
no matter how many things i save
the tangible will always be what i crave
but ive been resting cases
and writing just to erase this
it used to just seem so basic
when i knew every single word to say
howd this happen?
found your way in
so distracting
splitting me in half again
so distracting
splitting me in half again

thought id burn the seams if they frayed
thought id prove the point that i made
however long youre gone i will wait
however long youre gone i will wait
i will wait
