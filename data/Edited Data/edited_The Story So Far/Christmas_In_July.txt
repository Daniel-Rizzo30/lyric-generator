tell me how this came to be my reason to believe
true words spoken from the heart
forever spent waiting, a lifetime misbehaving
color me blessed, suitably impressed by your style

just when i thought i had it figured out
trapped and suffocated longing for a heart
big enough to accept me for the idiot i am
fate chose you and perfection stares me in the face

like christmas in july
the past we left behind
it's time to feel alive for once

the hand was dealt much different than before
one year hiatus felt like hundreds more, long enough
all those thoughts and letters that i wrote and never sent
a million words, you meant that much to me

this second chance you've given is all i'll ever need
suitably blessed, color me impressed by your smile
and i crave your smile, your style
