leaning on a bad knee
don't really wanna be with anyone
can you hear in my key?
how can you not see it's not always fun?
wait, score, speed back, lock the door, just pour
i'm gettin' numb
not enough, gimme more soda
soaking through the floor of 

my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone
my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone

glue me into my seat
spill onto my feet and let it run
'cause i am all that you need
the hunger i feed, my loaded gun
always sore in my back from the spine that i lack to really be done
that's enough, no more
i'm barely breathing anymore
ask me how did i let this get worse?
dove through the mud for my verse
tell me, how many wounds can you nurse?
dive into nothing head first

my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone
my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone

it's holding on but barely by the edge
you always ask me where i go
i'm high now, i'll hide it from you and her
my closest friends and everyone

my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone
my appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it
i can't believe you're still upset, get over it
and leave me alone
