i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
from the very first time i rest my eyes on you, girl
my heart says follow through

but i know now that i'm way down on your line
but the waiting feel is fine
so don't treat me like a puppet on a string
cause i know i have to do my thing

don't talk to me as if you think i'm dumb
i wanna know when you're gonna come

i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love

cause if summer is here
i'm still waiting there
winter is here
and i'm still waiting there

like i said
it's been three years since i'm knocking on your door
and i still can knock some more
oh girl, oh girl, is it feasible?
i wanna know now, for i to knock some more
you see, in life i know there's lots of grief
but your love is my relief
tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
while i'm waiting, while i'm waiting for my turn

i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love

i don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh
i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna
i don't wanna wait in vain
i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna
i don't wanna wait in vain
i don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh
i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna, i don't wanna
i don't wanna wait in vain
makes me love that you running from
its the love that i'm waiting vain
makes me love that you running from
its the love that i'm waiting vain
makes me love that you running from
