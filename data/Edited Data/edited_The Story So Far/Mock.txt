how can i just break it off
to leave for good and never talk?
im about to write it out for you to mock
clear my mind for the thousandth time
ive been too involved to call it off
i've been away for so long
all ive got are weak foundations, wishful thoughts
and all around a greater view

how do you think that thats okay?
to still like all the things i play?
to still try not to walk my way?
i taught you all those things i say
it's nothing like it used to be
theres no more of what i used to see
but you help me with my honesty
while im yelling at your ghost

make things worse, i always seem to make things worse
cause i can't seem to shake this curse
i can't seem to put you first
and i spend all my time with you in my hindsight
got so many questions that i'll ask when the times right
how can i just break it off
to leave for good and never talk?

and when you finally see the scope
feel the ghost grip of my choke
i wont know you, or love you less
and itll be effortless
