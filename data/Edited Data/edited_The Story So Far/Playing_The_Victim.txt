crushing you inside of my grip again
youre breathing in
pushing this aside till when?
ignoring that pain
felt you creep inside of my head again
it all depends on where i am and who im there with
its rough when were both square one
with so much undone
who lost, who won?
all rain, no sun
dont want to have to speak to anyone

said this will kill if you let it somehow i forget
i should be asleep i shouldnt be upset
playing the victim while youre still here
blaming the future on things i fear
i keep blaming the future on things i fear

waking up to gloom and routine again
youre breathing in
that air that dries your lungs
but you kept our trust
and said do what you must to be happy
and i left with a debt that called me out
quick to be honest with it all
so now i just sing (i just sing)
about missing this and missing that
but what will it really bring?
if were both square one
with so much undone
who lost, who won?
all rain

just a special circumstance
where in lies the worst part i cant accept
coming up on fall
are there things we havent spoke on yet?
said you wont reset
but you and i are one and the same
dont want to have to feel numb
i dont want this undone
dont want to have to speak to anyone
