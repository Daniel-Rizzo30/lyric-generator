chase me
fill in the gap now
gold in my iris
i miss how the waves sound
i haven't talked to my brother in over a year now
i hope that he's still proud

what's with the things i do?
to try to disconnect you two
tore all the fabric from our loom
and i hate that
my pessimistic views stem from all the drugs i use
hide all my guilt inside this bruise
it's my ruse

phase me, i feel the distance
i hear the cadence
the worst of all my sounds
i wanna see why you love her, why you're good
for each other but i just don't know how

what's with the things i do?
to try to disconnect you two
tore all the fabric from our loom
and i hate that
my pessimistic views stem from all the drugs i use
hide all my guilt inside this bruise
it's my ruse
bet if you keep this up
you'll die here all alone
yet you still fill your cup
nodding off, nodding off now

bet if you keep this up
you'll die here all alone
yet you still fill your cup
nodding off, nodding off now
