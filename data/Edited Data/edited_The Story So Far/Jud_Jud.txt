count me out of tradition
i think it's time for a change of style
picking up where we left off
so come on in and stay a while

reasons keep me from the truth
and push me farther away from you
why do you act the way you do
too big a mess to fix with glue

i know that things fell short of what you wanted and more
so take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone
so take the last bus home and keep the change, we're set in stone

this music is what i did choose
right here right now it's all i'll do
give me time and i will prove that i am here for all of you
