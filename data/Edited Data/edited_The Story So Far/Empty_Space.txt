all that i know
is your space is empty
its buried below
the stress and the envy
all the places i go
it still hasnt left me
i hated it then
and now it consumes me

i dwell on it nightly
tread swiftly and lightly
make up the lost ground
and see what you dont see
all the questions aside
i asked and you lied
and now my hands are tied

all i can show
is absence from your life
that i cant control
its all that i get right
keep paying the toll
i know that it seems like
im always upset
i know it seems like i'm always upset
(i know it seems like i'm always upset)
all that i know
is your space is empty
its buried below
it still hasnt left me
all that i know
is your space is empty
its buried below
it still hasnt left
