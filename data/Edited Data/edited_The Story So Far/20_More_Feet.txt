so why don't you just tell me now and stop procrastinating?
can't go this far and turn it down, let's start the celebrating
with these two hands i'll make ends meet so you won't have to worry
these days are short and nights are long so let's just tell a story

let's make way for a new day, don't even think of what to say
everything will be explained, don't wait to take it all away
take it all away

one by one we'll take them out, and save the best for last
you and me will fix this town and wipe away the past
so give me all of your grace and take me away
away from this place

take it away!

let's make way for a new day, don't even think of what to say
everything will be explained, don't wait to take it all away
