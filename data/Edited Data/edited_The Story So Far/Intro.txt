we're all we have!

we'll walk through this park in december
we'll close our eyes and try to remember
if this was just all for fun

talk to friends anticipate
and hours start to separate
when today

there's a time to live and a time to die
but right now its time you try
keep your head up
i'm not gonna lie
you're stronger now than you were before
keep your foot placed in the door
take two steps and you'll be wanting more

we'll sing through this part all together
we'll raise our voices to make it better
cause all we have is just right now
