(hahaha)

i'm getting closer and i don't know what to do
my bed's still messed up and my clothes still smell like you
we'll go together through this town, we'll walk
but recently the only deep thing is your talk

i know it hurts to be alone
but all this shows is that you haven't grown
still look at me, i'll watch you stare
those feelings are gone, so see if i care

survive the worst, and make the best
you deserve nothing short of being worthless
your priorities are such a mess
you're so far away from being selfless

stop looking through me and start looking at me
are you done talking cause this is exactly what i need!
just to make it through
drive away in your car and i'll just forget you
