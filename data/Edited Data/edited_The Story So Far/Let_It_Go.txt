anytime you come around i feel alone
i dont need your help can you tell from my tone
try to keep it casual nothing there to break the fall

all this time i spend with you is not enough
know youre sad inside so why you act so tough
fed up with my usual quit it cold and feel the lull

let it go, theres no lust now
im way ahead of you
can you hear me now?
im on your radio
can you pull me apart just the way you do?

anytime i see your face its just my own
ill be fine, just look how much that ive grown
how did you stay there i didnt play fair
you and i might be the only thing i know
set aside a place for both of us to go
i feel your hand inside of mine
no, i dont never mind
let it go, theres no lust now
im way ahead of you
can you hear me now?
im on your radio
can you pull me apart just the way you do?

let it go, theres no lust now
im way ahead of you
can you hear me now?
im on your radio
can you pull me apart
i won't let it bring me down again
