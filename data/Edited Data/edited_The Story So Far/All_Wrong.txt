i doubted the way that the space could be filled for so long
i was so headstrong that lately, just maybe i've been dead wrong
tried to see if i could speak about it
and now i dont know how to live without it right in the dent of my chest
feeding off your mind cause you know best
and craving the days with you and your bed that wait back west
its never enough, no its never enough, no its never enough

its no fun to play this song
so im done
you said i got it all wrong
but im sure everything we did before
doesnt really matter anymore
its no fun to play this song
so im done
you said i got it all wrong
but im sure everything i did before
doesn't really matter anymore

i woke up covered in the sweat again
worry and fog the lens
no solace i miss the fuck out of all my friends
i think back to sleeping on the back bench
wish id let the absence tell them all of the things that i cant
and now its all just patience
my father told me dont pass this up
and take all the luck you can get
its never enough, no it's never enough, no it's never enough
caught you leaving
you were high in the ceiling
on your own, on your own
dodge your demons
take your reasons
with you when you go, when you go

its no fun to play this song
so im done
you said i got it all wrong
but im sure everything we did before
doesnt really matter anymore
its no fun to play this song
so im done
you said i got it all wrong
but im sure everything i did before
doesn't really matter anymore

and everything we did before
it doesn't really matter anymore
and everything we did before
it doesn't really matter anymore
