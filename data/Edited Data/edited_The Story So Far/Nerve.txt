hard shove, feel the heavy weight
it's the same love that i push away
it be the same thing i always debate
why you left me here for another
these days i tend to see red
cause all the women swimming in my head
are not the same ones laying in my bed
but i do my best to ignore it

but you still come up
you still come up

it's all in my head, there's not much i can do
you set your pace, i'll keep mine too
each time i chase, i feel dark blue
confuse your face for someone new

i guess i owe you for most everything
like the way i feel and the curse you bring
you got a lot of nerve to wanna hear me sing
after you tossed us into the gutter
mad now like i was before
cause somebody's always asking who i do it for
but i don't wanna do it for you anymore
i do my best to ignore it


yeah i should let you go
away from the grey that we both know
and i can't pass through indio
without feeling indigo
yeah i should let this go
but it gets so hectic on my own
you can't be proud if i'm alone


but you still come up
you still come up
