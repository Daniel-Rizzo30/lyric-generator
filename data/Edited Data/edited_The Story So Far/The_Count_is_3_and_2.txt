look at yourself
through the eyes of the ones who despise you
and see if you like it too
cause realize, realize that the whole run was better than the view

find another one
you have yourselves to blame
reap what you had sown
we both know it's not the same

so tell me what you think
i will just close my ears
cause through the good times and through the bad
i learned to face my fears

find another one
(find another one)
you have yourselves to blame
reap what you had sown
(reap what you had sown)
we both know it's not the same
the same

search your heart
you'll find the truth that's all that matters right now
soon i bet we'll have each other somehow
we'll use our words to make this better right now
so don't count me out
woah woah woah
woah woah woah

find another one
you have yourselves to blame

find another one
you have yourselves to blame
reap what you had sown
we both know it's not the same
