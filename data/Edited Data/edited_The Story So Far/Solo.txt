when youre up north the ice is slick like my voice
shes like i never left you, this was all your choice
i cant doubt it now i might lose all my poise
when i mislead you on purpose and fade into the void
feeling indigo
how bout you?
i feel indigo

and i wish youd just call, and we could hash it out
i could tell you what im so mad about
bet youre sick of hearing me sulk and pout
had so much on my mind til now
like when we gonna do this, the where and how
and if i see you am i gonna curse you out
is it enough that im up right now?
does it anger you that i chose a different route?

cause im sick of feeling that im late
tired of having to restate i cant just sit around
and wait, youre just not someone i can date
now look who cant hold their weight
i hope im wrong just for your sake
using pills and flowers to sedate
find me heal me keep my faith
you have to know every place i go
that feeling stuck that i offered trust and it left me solo
and if i havent grown from every face ive known
is it all for naught? is that food for thought?
theres things you dont know

cause im sick of feeling that im late
tired of having to restate i cant just sit around
and wait, youre just not someone i can date
now look who cant hold their weight
i hope im wrong just for your sake
using pills and flowers to sedate
find me heal me keep my faith

i feel indigo, youve got what i need
im indigo, youve got what i need
youre not what i need
