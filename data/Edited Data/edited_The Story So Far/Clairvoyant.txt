i think you'll notice when things become different
the good vibes in our lives won't feel so consistent
and less becomes more 'cause the weight is too heavy
i swim in the water that's breaking your levee

the way that you left me is alright, it's alright
if i argue the point then we yell and we fight
and i won't be home for the rest of the night
you might hate my words but you know that i'm right
you know that i'm right

this is your life, there's no way to run from it
the doubt in your brain or the pain in your stomach
i only have but one complaint at the moment
don't paint me black when i used to be golden

the way that you left me is alright, it's alright
if i argue the point then we yell and we fight
and i won't be home for the rest of the night
you might hate my words but you know that i'm right
you know that i'm right
don't paint me black when i used to be golden
