i know obama was heavensent
but ever since trump won it proved that i could be president
yeah you can at what cost though
dont that go against the teachings that ye taught for
yo tip i hear your side and everybody talk though
but aint goin against the grain everything i fought for
prolly so ye but where you tryna go with this
its some shit you just dont align with and dont go against
you just readin the headlines you dont see the fine print
you on some choosinside shit im on some unified shit
its bigger than your selfish agenda
if your election aint gon stop police from murderin niggas
then shit
bruh i never ever stopped fightin for the people
actually wearin the hatll show people that we equal
you gotta see the vantage point of the people
what makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
see thats the problem with this damn nation
all blacks gotta be democrats man
we aint made it off the plantation
fuck who you choose as your political party
you representin dudes just seem crude and coldhearted
with blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
dont you feel an obligation to them
i feel a obligation to show people new ideas
and if you wanna hear em there go two right here
make america great again had a negative perception
i took it wore it rocked it gave it a new direction
added empathy care and love and affection
and yall simply questionin my methods
what you willin to lose for the point to be proved
this shit is stubborn selfish bullheaded even for you
you wore a dustyass hat to represent the same views
as white supremacy man we expect better from you
all them times you sounded crazy we defended you homie
not just to be let down when we depend on you homie
thats why its important to know what direction youre goin now
cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
you think i aint concerned about how i affect the past
i mean that hat stayed in my closet like bout a year and a half
then one day i was like fuck it ima do me
i was in the sunken place and then i found the new me
not worried about some image that i gotta keep up
lot of people agree with me but theyre too scared to speak up
the greater good of the people is first
have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt
you had a bad idea and youre makin it worse
this shits just as bad as catholic preachers rapin in church
yall been leadin with hate see i just approach it different
like a gang truce the first blood to shake the crips hand
i know everybody emotional
is it better if i rap about crack huh cause its cultural
or how about ima shoot you or fuck your bitch
or how about all this gucci cause im fuckin rich
youll deal with god for the lack of respect
startin to make it seem like donnie cut you a check
now you toyin with hot lava better be careful with that
whats it mean to gain the world if you aint standin for shit
okay i gotta say it ye you sound high as a bigot
yeah genocide and slavery we should just try and forget
and all that free thought shit find a better defense
but if ye just stuck in his way he can leave it at that
fuck it
alright tip we could be rappin about this all day man
why dont we just cut the beat off and let the people talk","['i', 'know', 'obama', 'was', 'heavensent', 'but', 'ever', 'since', 'trump', 'won', 'it', 'proved', 'that', 'i', 'could', 'be', 'president',

1,edited_DONDA_(2012),"i appreciate everyones support for my clothing line but i wanted to clarify a few things the name of the line is kanye west not dw the dw was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom  i really appreciate the fake dw twitter page but since its not official i cant cosign any information on it
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication  leonardo da vinci
more clarity i have no agency representing me currently william morris was fired after cara lewis quit i love cara lewis 
i love being back at my fashion office learning and creating its so challenging and fun and im surrounded by amazing people they say you only live once but every time i come to work i feel like im starting a second life you guys might think i have some type of backing for my line but i dont i did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money i made touring to follow my passion ive been working at this for  years now from the first offers to do urban clothing lines that i turned downto begging bape to do my line and never making any real headwayto having an office in la that was shut down after the mtv moment along with my tour with lady gaga
i moved to japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room i had this opportunity to intern at fendi and was also offered a position at versace which i could not take due to my contract with lv which was for  years i moved to rome after i left japan and worked at fendi for  months undercover i was there to give ideas for the mens collection i snuck to giuseppe zanottis factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for  years before my first show in paris after doing the first lv collection i was sure i would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
i designed a sneaker called the air yeezy with nike im allowed to design  pair of sneakers every  years i have more ideas
early  i moved to paris and opened a small design studio the language barrier was quite difficult i still dont have a paris vat number to this day i dont know what a vat is but every time i asked why we didnt have fabrics they said it was because of the vat in paris i met many great people in design including the master azzedine alaia azzedine even came by my studio one day  this was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small paris studio in a courtyard opposite collate
i remember being  years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots she said i would always point to the most expensive furs even as a child lol there is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point for the first  or  years of my life the only thing i knew about womens clothing was what my mom would wear i guess some critics would joke that i still dont know anything lol my mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished cosby show sweater  to pick me up from school the teachers said i couldnt focus i used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing nikes in th grade
being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively i was just discussing becoming the creative director for the jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out you should do a jetsons tour
this just happened a few hours ago i was very insulted of course because for anyone thats seen the watch the throne tour coachella glow in the dark or runaway know that i have real ideas
i appreciate having the most nominations at the grammys but i feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical good logic tells me smile kanye the world likes you again red or blue pillaaaaand swallow lol i wouldnt have the prestige i have if it wasnt partially for the grammys validation and i honor that
hmmmmm what to wear here i go again yeezy the trend setter or complete fcking fashion victimthe verdict is still out this is just a train of thought but i figure its better to read than trained thoughts
what good is fame and prestige if you cant use it to help people i want to help by doing what i know how to do bestcreate
i have started a new company and im so excited about the nameits got the best name everof all companiesof all time
the name of the company is donda
donda is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas i used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out dr dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product i am assembling a team of architects graphic designers directors musicians producers ars writers publicist social media experts app guys managers car designers clothing designers djs video game designers publishers tech guys lawyers bankers nutritionists doctors scientists and teachers
donda will be comprised of over  divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford i want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me we want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear touch taste and feel to dream of create advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need to marry our wants and needsdonda
this will all take time but i wanted everyones to know what i really care abouti care about peoplei care about my fansi care about people who have never heard of methere are over  billion people on the planet nowits something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right  my mom was an english teacher so i know she sends an smdh from heaven   am in london my dreams keep me woke
the watch the throne tour was a small example of what a donda experience can be
im currently working on a new  screen experience

this is one of our projects to be released this year called  olympicsits semi scifi since  is only  years away 
we would also like to design the mtv awards were taking everything  steps at a time lol i wanted to put this in the world in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out we need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved come get on boarddont just sit therereach out
we can collectively effect the world through design we need to pick up where steve jobs left off
when i said wealthy i wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education school systems were designed to turn people into factory workers schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life
spike jonze and i want to do a summer school that tries new forms of curriculum math classes should teach addition subtraction multiplication division accounting and money management aaaaaand cut
unless youre a math major kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iphoneswhy not promote it
allow kids to use search engines to do testlike the real world give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfectplease excuse my grammari know its extremely ironic
some kids have better memories than otherswhat about emotional iqs what about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are
excuse mei just get excited at the possibilitiesthe more excited i get the more grammatical errors youll see
we need to take what michael jackson felt and mcqueen and steve jobs and we need make things better
when me and jay toured every night i peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
the adrenaline is runningi dont know if i can even get to sleep now from wall street to the london riots to chicago murdersi sit everyday and ask what can i do to make a difference i know this is not a very rapper thing to say but i havent bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about  years
i invest every dime back into creativity hiring amazing creatives paying for flights officesetc my area of expertise is in music my passion is in music design film and productsmy strength is connectivity
there are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systemswe need experts for this we need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments
i just wanted to share whats been on my mind
if you have an apple and i have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and i will still each have one applebut if you have an idea and i have an idea and we exchange these ideas then each of us will have two ideas  george bernard shaw","['i', 'appreciate', 'everyones', 'support', 'for', 'my', 'clothing', 'line', 'but', 'i', 'wanted', 'to', 'clarify', 'a', 'few', 'things', 'the', 'name',

had made everyone mad
he made s so hes everyone dad know he ever gets sad
hotel rooms by the shore close my eyes i can see more
nobody punkin me nobody pressure me nobody gangsta me
especially when the gangstas eat thanks to me
and my favorite principal name was mrs wooten
she was strict the perfect instructor for young putin
vladimir just so that is clear
whom should we fear when we know dad is here
daddys right here daddys right here
i dont play boy
over yall dead body fore my daughter pose in playboy
we dont condone oversexualization of the kids in the home
battery in my back
this house of pain wont ever last
cyhi told me to my face that sicko mode was his biggest song
well gon cause donda was the best ghostwriter i ever had
south park had jokes about fish sticks
til this day the whole team can kiss this dick
i put virgil and drake on the same text
and it wasnt about the matching arcteryx or kid cudi dress
just told these grown men stop it with the funny shit
i might hire the whole team from acg
so dont text me like im juanita jcv
or more important monica corgan who was there for me
somebody really there for me was rare for me
that was new air to breathe
when i was underappreciated undervaluated
stockholders told me board rooms will bore you
cant remember going by your rules try to follow the lords rules
thought we was the new abu dhabi
told drake dont play with me on gd
and he sent that message to everybody
so if i hit you with a wyd
you better hit me with yes sir im writing everything you need
i told you i was gonna take the summer back
so any of the cap wont take none of that
where my motherfuckin red hat
security and the nannies be forever handling
i cant stand it when theres talks about puttin the kids back in
sierra canyon when daddy got his own school
trav smile for these white people if you want cmon
while we build a team to get hoover out the joint
i do what i want bro in my life
serve and protect long as its my wife
screaming on mans for trying to lower the percentage of skims
see i was going in
back when they thought i was only making ms now its ninebilli
you aint gotta like me but you feel me
do yall feel me really

ive been waiting on this my whole life and i wonder
these dreams be waking me up at night and i wonder
you say i think im never wrong and i wonder
you know what maybe youre right aight


you say he get on your fucking nerves and i wonder
you hope that he get what he deservesword and i wonder
do you even remember what the issue is
you just trying to find where the tissue is
you can still be who you wish you is
it aint happen yet and thats what intuition is and i wonder
when you hop back in the car
drive back to the crib run back to their arms
the smokescreens the chokes and the screams
you ever wonder what it all really means

and im back on my grind
a psychic read my lifeline told me in my lifetime
my name would help light up the chicago skyline
and thats why im and i wonder
seven oclock thats primetime
heavenll watch god calling from the hotlines
why he keep giving me hot lines
im a star how could i not shine and i wonder
how many ladies in the house if you know
how many ladies in the house without a spouse what it means
something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused what it means
what you about and i wonder
on that independent shit if you know
trade it all for a husband and some kids what it means
you ever wonder what it all really mean
you wonder if youll ever find your dreams
to find your dreams come true","['ive', 'been', 'waiting', 'on', 'this', 'my', 'whole', 'life', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'these', 'dreams', 'be', 'waking', 'me', 'up', 'at', 'night', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'you', 'say', 'i', 'think', 'im', 'never', 'wrong', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'you', 'know', 'what', 'maybe', 'youre', 'right', 'aight', 'you', 'say', 'he', 'get', 'on', 'your', 'fucking', 'nerves', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'you', 'hope', 'that', 'he', 'get', 'what', 'he', 'deservesword', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'do', 'you', 'even', 'remember', 'what', 'the', 'issue', 'is', 'you', 'just', 'trying', 'to', 'find', 'where', 'the', 'tissue', 'is', 'you', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'who', 'you', 'wish', 'you', 'is', 'it', 'aint', 'happen', 'yet', 'and', 'thats', 'what', 'intuition', 'is', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'when', 'you', 'hop', 'back', 'in', 'the', 'car', 'drive', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'crib', 'run', 'back', 'to', 'their', 'arms', 'the', 'smokescreens', 'the', 'chokes', 'and', 'the', 'screams', 'you', 'ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'it', 'all', 'really', 'means', 'and', 'im', 'back', 'on', 'my', 'grind', 'a', 'psychic', 'read', 'my', 'lifeline', 'told', 'me', 'in', 'my', 'lifetime', 'my', 'name', 'would', 'help', 'light', 'up', 'the', 'chicago', 'skyline', 'and', 'thats', 'why', 'im', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'seven', 'oclock', 'thats', 'primetime', 'heavenll', 'watch', 'god', 'calling', 'from', 'the', 'hotlines', 'why', 'he', 'keep', 'giving', 'me', 'hot', 'lines', 'im', 'a', 'star', 'how', 'could', 'i', 'not', 'shine', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'ladies', 'in', 'the', 'house', 'if', 'you', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'ladies', 'in', 'the', 'house', 'without', 'a', 'spouse', 'what', 'it', 'means', 'something', 'in', 'your', 'blouse', 'got', 'me', 'feeling', 'so', 'aroused', 'what', 'it', 'means', 'what', 'you', 'about', 'and', 'i', 'wonder', 'on', 'that', 'independent', 'shit', 'if', 'you', 'know', 'trade', 'it', 'all', 'for', 'a', 'husband', 'and', 'some', 'kids', 'what', 'it', 'means', 'you', 'ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'it', 'all', 'really', 'mean', 'you', 'wonder', 'if', 'youll', 'ever', 'find', 'your', 'dreams', 'to', 'find', 'your', 'dreams', 'come', 'true']"

you need somethin unexpected some form of weapon
you ask him to feel protected and still feel protected

one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow

man its too early
what the hell you doin wakin me up at 
why the hell are you worried
play somethin that is very very vibeworthy
i dont know want my mind alerting
people sayin tweetin gonna make you die early
how bout have my heart hurtin
hold it all inside that could make you die early
go on and get your best attorney
somethings there feel it when i heard it
just release the spirit let it flow though
how these  leaving now with one leg like flojo
nail me to the cross with long nails like coko
free throat coat for the throat goats
even if i gotta do it solo even if i gotta do it with no promo
i aint got my point across
til we finally get across and pass the point
so theres a couple things that i gotta quote
dont involve yourself in things you dont have to know
i aint never question what you was askin for
i gave you every single thing you was askin for
i dont understand how anybody could ask for more
got a list of even more i just laugh it off
i be goin through things i had to wrote
celebrity drama that only bradll know
too many family secrets somebody passin notes
things i cried about i found laughable
lil baby jesus aint laughing no
dont involve yourself in things they aint have to know
the big man upstairs aint laughin no
dont involve yourself in things they aint have to know

got caught with thirty rocks the cop look like alec baldwin
intercentury anthems based off innercity tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it jerome get more time than brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag
and tell me that its random
but we stay winning
this week has been a bad massage i need a happy ending
and a new beginning and a new fitted
and some job opportunities thats lucrative
this the real world homie school finished
they done stole your dreams you dont know who did it
i treat the cash the way the government treats aids
i wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
is hiphop just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
but this is more than just my road to redemption
malcolm west had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as im in polo smiling they think they got me
but theyd try to crack me if they ever see a black me
i thought i chose a field where they couldnt sack me
if a nigga aint shootin a jumpshot runnin a track meet
but this pimp is at the top of mount olympus
ready for the worlds games this is my olympics
we make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a south park writer with a fishstick
i insisted to get up off of this dick
and these drugs niggas cant resist it
remind me when they tried to have ali enlisted
if i ever wasnt the greatest nigga i must have missed it
i need more drinks and less lights
and that american apparel girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get in a school
he said take them glasses off and get in the pool
its been a while since i watched the tube
cause like a crip set i got way too many blues for any more bad news
i was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history i dont believe in yesterday
and whats a black beatle anyway a fuckin roach
i guess thats why they got me sitting in fuckin coach
my guy said i need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like im sniffin coke
its not funny anymore try different jokes
tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
and kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while i got it
play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit

i aint got it im coming after whoever who has it
im coming after whoever who has it
you blowin up thats good fantastic

picture us in the mall coppin iceberg and yell out jigga
yeah thats what well yell out yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell bout
jay and ye so shy
that he wont even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind he could change your life
with all these beats i did at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands
fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothing handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint 
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hed bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin sobs and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands
have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steeple
and we know new jack citygot to keep my brother
but to be number one ima beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
and my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate español no way josé
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
my big brother was bigs brother
so heres a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell em
a idol in my eyes god of the game
heart of the city rocafella chain
never be the same never be another
number one young hov also my big brother

111,edited_I_Thought_About_Killing_You,"i know i know i know i know know
i know i know i know i know know
i i know it i know it

the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
today i seriously thought about killing you
i contemplated premeditated murder
and i think about killing myself
and i love myself way more than i love you so
today i thought about killing you premeditated murder
youd only care enough to kill somebody you love
the most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
mhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
just say it out loud to see how it feels
people say dont say this dont say that
just say it out loud just to see how it feels
weigh all the options nothings off the table
today i thought about killing you premeditated murder
i think about killing myself
and i i love myself way more than i love you
the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
mhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
i think this is the part where im supposed to say somethin good to compensate it so it doesnt come off bad
but sometimes i think really bad things
really really really bad things
and i love myself way more than i love you
see if i was tryin to relate it to more people
id probably say im struggling with loving myself
because that seems like a common theme
but thats not the case here
i love myself way more than i love you
and i think about killing myself
so best believe i thought about killing you today
premeditated murder
i called up my loved ones i called up my cousins
i called up the muslims said im bout to go dumb
get so bright its no sun get so loud i hear none
screamed so loud got no lungs hurt so bad i go numb
time to bring in the drums that prrapapapum
set the newtone on em set the nuke off on em
i need coke with no rum i taste coke on her tongue
i dont joke with no one theyll say he died so young
i done had a bad case of too many bad days
got too many bad traits used the floor for ashtrays

what up ye this larry hoover jr
first and foremost i wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the oval office
you might not have been the only one that couldve did that but you were the one that did do that
and with your assistance we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
you know to me it kind of feels like me my mother my brothers and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we havent even been to jail
we have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
my fathers truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community tell me if you know someone that needs
because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and its what made the children of today
after twentyfive years of bein locked down twentythree and one my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
and will not once released call any shots for the gangster disciples
if my fathers intentions were to lead us to death destruction into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twentysix years
man he would be dead to me
i didnt sign up for that
i didnt stay on this journey this long for that
all my life man ive been waitin for my father to come home
they told me when i graduate eighth grade he would be home
then they told me when i graduate from high school he would be home
i went away to morris brown i graduated and he still aint home
now im an adult and my daughter went away to college and graduated
he still not home
now even more than that my son he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin
matter of fact he hasnt hugged kissed or touched any of his grandchildren
and they havent been able to touch they grandfather

whose fault




on the bathroom wall i wrote
id rather argue with you than to be with someone else
i took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
and i went and found somebody else
fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
yo id rather be by my fuckin self
til about  am and i call back
and i hang up and i start to blame myself
somebody help
you werent perfect but you made life worth it
stick around some real feelings might surface
been a long time since i spoke to you in a bathroom
grippin you up fuckin and chokin you
what the hell was i supposed to do
i know you aint gettin this type of dick from that local dude
and if you are i hope you have a good time
cause i definitely be havin mine
and you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
every time i hear about other niggas is strokin you
lie and say i hit you he sittin there consoling you
runnin my name through the mud whos provoking you
you should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
 am and cant nobody get a hold of you
im callin your brothers phone like what was i supposed to do
even though i knew he never told the truth
he was just gon say whatever that you told him to
at a certain point i had to stop asking questions
yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
i heard he bought some coke with my money that aint right girl
you gettin blackmailed for that white girl
you always said yeezy i aint your right girl
youll probably find one of them i like arttype girls
all of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
and i was satisfied bein in love with a lie
now who to blame you to blame
me to blame for the pain
and it poured every time when it rained
things used to be now they not
anything but us is who we are
disguising ourselves as secret lovers
weve become public enemies
we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another
so far from where we came
with so much of everything
how do we leave with nothing
lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of love
hatred and attitude tear us entirely
chloe mitchell

lets play the blame game i love you more
lets play the blame game for sure
lets call out names names i hate you more
lets call out names names for sure

i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much no i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
and i know that you are somewhere doing your thing
and when the phone called it just ring and ring
you aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
and i heard the whole thing
i heard the whole thing whole thing whole thing whole thing","['whose', 'fault', 'on', 'the', 'bathroom', 'wall', 'i', 'wrote', 'id', 'rather', 'argue', 'with', 'you', 'than', 'to', 'be', 'with', 'someone', 'else', 'i', 'took', 'a', 'piss', 'and', 'dismiss', 'it', 'like', 'fuck', 'it', 'and', 'i', 'went', 'and', 'found', 'somebody', 'else', 'fuck', 'arguing', 'and', 'harvesting', 'the', 'feelings', 'yo', 'id', 'rather', 'be', 'by', 'my', 'fuckin', 'self', 'til', 'about', '', 'am', 'and', 'i', 'call', 'back', 'and', 'i', 'hang', 'up', 'and', 'i', 'start', 'to', 'blame', 'myself', 'somebody', 'help', 'you', 'werent', 'perfect', 'but', 'you', 'made', 'life', 'worth', 'it', 'stick', 'around', 'some', 'real', 'feelings', 'might', 'surface', 'been', 'a', 'long', 'time', 'since', 'i', 'spoke', 'to', 'you', 'in', 'a', 'bathroom', 'grippin', 'you', 'up', 'fuckin', 'and', 'chokin', 'you', 'what', 'the', 'hell', 'was', 'i', 'supposed', 'to', 'do', 'i', 'know', 'you', 'aint', 'gettin', 'this', 'type', 'of', 'dick', 'from', 'that', 'local', 'dude', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'i', 'hope', 'you', 'have', 'a', 'good', 'time', 'cause', 'i', 'definitely', 'be', 'havin', 'mine', 'and', 'you', 'aint', 'finna', 'see', 'a', 'mogul', 'get', 'emotional', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'hear', 'about', 'other', 'niggas', 'is', 'strokin', 'you', 'lie', 'and', 'say', 'i', 'hit', 'you', 'he', 'sittin', 'there', 'consoling', 'you', 'runnin', 'my', 'name', 'through', 'the', 'mud', 'whos', 'provoking', 'you', 'you', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'a', 'nigga', 'like', 'me', 'ever', 'noticed', 'you', 'now', 'you', 'noticeable', 'and', 'cant', 'nobody', 'get', 'control', 'of', 'you', 'am', 'and', 'cant', 'nobody', 'get', 'a', 'hold', 'of', 'you', 'im', 'callin', 'your', 'brothers', 'phone', 'like', 'what', 'was', 'i', 'supposed', 'to', 'do', 'even', 'though', 'i', 'knew', 'he', 'never', 'told', 'the', 'truth', 'he', 'was', 'just', 'gon', 'say', 'whatever', 'that', 'you', 'told', 'him', 'to', 'at', 'a', 'certain', 'point', 'i', 'had', 'to', 'stop', 'asking', 'questions', 'yall', 'got', 'dirt', 'on', 'each', 'other', 'like', 'mud', 'wrestlers', 'i', 'heard', 'he', 'bought', 'some', 'coke', 'with', 'my', 'money', 'that', 'aint', 'right', 'girl', 'you', 'gettin', 'blackmailed', 'for', 'that', 'white', 'girl', 'you', 'always', 'said', 'yeezy', 'i', 'aint', 'your', 'right', 'girl', 'youll', 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'of', 'them', 'i', 'like', 'arttype', 'girls', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'lights', 'she', 'was', 'caught', 'in', 'the', 'hype', 'girl', 'and', 'i', 'was', 'satisfied', 'bein', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'a', 'lie', 'now', 'who', 'to', 'blame', 'you', 'to', 'blame', 'me', 'to', 'blame', 'for', 'the', 'pain', 'and', 'it', 'poured', 'every', 'time', 'when', 'it', 'rained', 'things', 'used', 'to', 'be', 'now', 'they', 'not', 'anything', 'but', 'us', 'is', 'who', 'we', 'are', 'disguising', 'ourselves', 'as', 'secret', 'lovers', 'weve', 'become', 'public', 'enemies', 'we', 'walk', 'away', 'like', 'strangers', 'in', 'the', 'street', 'gone', 'for', 'eternity', 'we', 'erased', 'one', 'another', 'so', 'far', 'from', 'where', 'we', 'came', 'with', 'so', 'much', 'of', 'everything', 'how', 'do', 'we', 'leave', 'with', 'nothing', 'lack', 'of', 'visual', 'empathy', 'equates', 'the', 'meaning', 'of', 'love', 'hatred', 'and', 'attitude', 'tear', 'us', 'entirely', 'chloe', 'mitchell', 'lets', 'play', 'the', 'blame', 'game', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'more', 'lets', 'play', 'the', 'blame', 'game', 'for', 'sure', 'lets', 'call', 'out', 'names', 'names', 'i', 'hate', 'you', 'more', 'lets', 'call', 'out', 'names', 'names', 'for', 'sure', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'no', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'i', 'cant', 'love', 'you', 'this', 'much', 'and', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'are', 'somewhere', 'doing', 'your', 'thing', 'and', 'when', 'the', 'phone', 'called', 'it', 'just', 'ring', 'and', 'ring', 'you', 'aint', 'pick', 'up', 'but', 'your', 'phone', 'accidentally', 'called', 'me', 'back', 'and', 'i', 'heard', 'the', 'whole', 'thing', 'i', 'heard', 'the', 'whole', 'thing', 'whole', 'thing', 'whole', 'thing', 'whole', 'thing']"

trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
arent you a sight for red eyes
i just flew in and slipped in on your left side
just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up


we had problems but its all in the past
everybody got problems baby algebra class
remember i used to do things thatd make you laugh
like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
you like piña coladas getting caught in the rain
or rocking flannels all summer like kurt cobain
or that dolce gabbana with a few gold chains
and you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
but they never let us do our thing
everybody lying on who i bang
we was on fire but they blew our flame
aint no denying baby you have changed
cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
friends all diss him like no he didnt
no he didnt is you talking about kitten
is that bitch still stripping
trying to get a pair of christians
i swear to god that they got you going crazy
but you play it off and say how is work baby
well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
but seem to still love the man that they all hate
but babe i call you back and say that you say that always
and kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
see she knew about all my lies the whole time
and my credits so bad i cant get no one to cosign
i wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
but she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
now she back in the club in a tight dress
with dreams of someday wearing a white dress
seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
plus i dont like none of her girlfriends
quote unquote cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
on the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
lets fly to euro and make this the best summer ever
now she heading to rome rome is the home
rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
i accept that i was wrong except a nigga grown
so i cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
so a nigga had to hop on a plane
a bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
and told her even though i met you in a club in a tight dress
at first sight i could picture you in a white dress
thirty foot train diamond from lorraine
just to make up for all the years and the pain
family on both sides im so glad you came
aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
wedding in june what could be better
lets fly to euro make this the best summer ever
take the very last car of the eurostar
tell the conductor just drive so far
told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
we will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
tell peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot uh","['trying', 'to', 'sneak', 'upstairs', 'to', 'your', 'apartment', 'arent', 'you', 'a', 'sight', 'for', 'red', 'eyes', 'i', 'just', 'flew',

what up ye this larry hoover jr
first and foremost i wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the oval office
you might not have been the only one that couldve did that
but you were the one that did do that
and with your assistance we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
you know to me it kinda feels like
me my mother my brothers and my kids
have all been incarcerated through this journey
and we havent even been to jail
we have been looked at and treated as criminals
for being a part of this family
my fathers truth and the reality that he raised me in
is that he wanted to make a change in this community tell me if you know someone that needs
cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
and it is what made the children of today
after twentyfive years of bein locked down twentythree and one
my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
and will not once released call any shots for the gangster disciples
if my fathers intentions were to lead us to death destruction
into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twentysix years
man he would be dead to me
i didnt sign up for that
i didnt stay on this journey this long for that
all my life man
ive been waitin for my father to come home
they told me when i graduate eighth grade he would be home
then they told me when i graduate from high school he would be home
i went away to morris brown i graduated and he still aint home
now im a adult and my daughter went away to college and graduated
he still not home
now even more than that my son he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin
matter of fact he hasnt hugged kissed or touched any of his grandchildren
and they havent been able to touch they grandfather
even though it is not seen that way for some of us
but for many of us larry hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
who deserves to breathe free air
free my father jesus mr larry hoover sr lord","['tell', 'me', 'if', 'you', 'know', 'someone', 'that', 'needs', 'jesus', 'lord', 'now', 'weve', 'been', 'through', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'things', 'tell',

yall had your ups and downs i dont fuck around
put everything on the something then you go and fuck around
bet you felt something now you feel nothing now
yall feelings felt something yall dont feel nothing now
her tears dried up from bumping expressionless
i was under exodus and learning what the lessons is
what the ebony of essences the genesis

back in the lab and shit

my wife said i cant say no to nobody
and at this rate we gon both die broke
got friends that ask me for money knowin im in debt
and like my wife said i still didnt say no
people tryna say im goin crazy on twitter
my friends best advice was to stay low
i guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
especially when you got family members on payroll
the media said it was outlandish spendin
the media said hes way out of control
i just feel like im the only one not pretendin
im not out of control im just not in their control
i know im the most influential
that time cover was just confirmation
this generations closest thing to einstein
so dont worry about me im fine
i can see a thousand years from now in real life
skate on the paradigm and shift it when i feel like
troll conventional thought dont need to question
i know its antiquated so sometimes i get aggressive
thank god for jay electra he down with the mission
did it with no permission on our own conditions
most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
yeezy with the big house did it way different
never listen to hollywood producers
dont stare at money too long its medusa
the ultimate gemini has survived
i wasnt supposed to make it past 

ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
a million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
i believe in the children listen to the kids bro
if the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
brother don muhammad told the minister about the presentation
he sat back and smiled
black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
the jews share their truth on how to make a dime
most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
but buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
well it all looks great
four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
the light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
real family stick together and see through the mirage
the smokescreens perceptions of false reality
who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
i am one with the people
i am one with the people real
ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
checkin instagram comments to crowdsource my selfesteem
let me not say too much or do too much
cause if im up way too much im out of touch
im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
so the people can see my light now its not just rappin
god i have humbled myself before the court
drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
i know i know he got a plan i know im on your beams
one set of footsteps you was carryin me
when i turned on the news and they was buryin me
one set of footsteps you was carryin me
when i was negotiatin with apple it was larry and me
told tim cook to call me i was scary to see
i wouldve took a hundred million and gave twenty to hov
i heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
but its better that i stayed at home with my folks
cause if jay a billionaire then ima never go broke
only thing i ask is next time im on stage we all go
we all go
not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres waldo
she got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at aldo

you never know homie might meet some hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

my homie mali used to stay at th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet a school full of stones
he nicknamed me krock so theyd leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
back when we rocked ellesses he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers even more by polices
howd he get the cash the day his father passed away
left him with a lil something sixteen he was stuntin
al b sure nigga with the hair all wavy
hit lake shore girls go all crazy
hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
boned so much that summer even had him a baby
see back back then then if you had a car
you was the chitown version of baby
and i was just a virgin a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
felt like i was almost signed when the shit got cranked
wed take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had them lincolns and aururrras we was hurting em all
with the girls a lot of flirting involved but dog
fuck all that flirtingnow im tryna get in some drawers
so put me on with these hoes homie
he told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
drive slow homie
drive slow
you never know homie about these hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie


turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
drive slow homie
if youre riding around the city with nowhere to go
drive slow homie
live today cause tomorrow man you never know
you never know homie might meet some hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
my cars like the movie my cars like the crib
i got more tvs in here than where i live
and that dont make no sense but baby im the shit
and everything i flip you know its something serious
i got the custom grill i got the brabus rims
i got the baller genetics baby this evidence
you see a player flicking and how you aint convinced
that you should go on and kiss it just a lil bit just a lil bit
i wear my custom kicks i got my jesus chain
my canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
they see me hoes actin like they seen a king

and i am a nigga i know what they want
i pray that you dont get it all at once
curves under your dress i know its pervs all on the net
all in the comments you wanna vomit
thats your baby you love her to death
now she cuttin class and hangin with friends
you break a glass and say it again
she cant comprehend the danger she in
if you whoop her ass she move in with him
then he whoop her ass you go through it again
but how you the devil rebukin the sin
lets pray we can put this behind us
i swear that these times is the wildest
she got the scars they serve as reminders
blood still on her pajamas
but yesterday is dead yeah moment of silence
next shell be off to college and then at the altar
cause she know that niggas is savage niggas is monsters
niggas is pimps niggas is players til niggas have daughters
