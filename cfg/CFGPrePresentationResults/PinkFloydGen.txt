Birds got home cold 
Louder than words 
Floating with that month in winter 
Me was all going to get here weary for me 
These person hand river 
Let I like not green John Oh 
And even all movement Anzio can frighten applied on oh feet leading off the ground 
My head is breathing me home 
Run 
Two one two Did is on blame their stand 
Waiting for the worms to come Lorca to calm 
Do it back some inner tide though you faces everything 
And all candle in my hall eyes from the weak Bear mouse 
Doo winner 
Sorry over the locks which was it 
Running before long Cambridgeshire Change 
You know just keep a barrow glimpse
